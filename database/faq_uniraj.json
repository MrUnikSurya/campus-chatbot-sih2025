The COVID-19 outbreak also put the HEI community ‘online’, particularly\nencompassing VCs, faculty, students, and support staff who needed to adjust comfortably and\nsafely to the emerging demands of cyber security. Due to the lack of awareness of cybersecurity and\ntrust in Cyberspace, HEIs have had some concerns towards the smooth transition to an ‘online’ mode\nof education. Therefore, it is imperative that creating awareness about Cyber threats and\nadherence to healthy Cyber hygiene practices will strengthen the cyber security ecosystem of HEIs.\nThe National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which also promotes digitalization in education,\nidentifies the need to leverage the use of technology in teaching while recognizing its potential risks\nand dangers. It has to be determined how the benefits of online/digital education can be reaped\nwhile addressing the concerns of the digital divide.\nOur Higher Education Institutions must also come forward to develop good cyber hygiene habits\nand to address the new normal for cyber security. This will help the learners and organizations to\nreduce potential cyber risks with a security-centric approach and behavior.\nTo develop an ecosystem for cyber security in the cyberspace of HEIs, UGC has developed this\n“Handbook on Basics of Digital Hygiene for Higher Education”. This will enable HEIs and their\nstakeholders to practice good cyber hygiene habits and to stay cyber secure. This document focuses\non the key topics of cyber security, which help the learners to understand the basic concept of\nCyber Hygiene, attacking vectors, preventive measures, tools to safeguard, the legal framework\nfor cyber security, career opportunities, and ways for strengthening teachers, students and IT\nteams of Higher Education Institutions. HEIs must use sophisticated technologies/ techniques to\nprotect their assets and make their faculties and students digitally empowered and secure.\nI would like to acknowledge the valuable contribution of the Chairman of the Committee,\nShri Abhishek Singh, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information\nTechnology (MeitY); Shri Rajesh Kumar, CEO, Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C);\nShri Nishant Kumar, Director (NCFL & NCEMU), I4C; Prof. (Dr.) Charru Malhotra, Professor\n(e-Governance and ICT) at Indian Institute of Public Administration and all other members of\nthe Committee in developing this document. I am also thankful to the UGC officials for\nproviding their necessary support and relevant input.\nI hope this handbook on digital hygiene will become a primer for administrators, teachers, and\nstudents in higher education across the country and help them achieve cyber empowerment.\nProf. M.

hygiene was first coined by Dr. Eduardo Gelbstein in 2006 in his book “Good\nDigital Hygiene.” ‘Digital Hygiene’ is also called ‘Cyber Hygiene. In this document, we shall\nprimarily confine to the basic concepts related to digital hygiene.\nDigital Hygiene can be defined as adhering to practices and behaviours that help keep the digital\nworld safe and secure. They are basic and essential activities that keep digital devices free from any\ncyber threats or ‘vulnerabilities.’ It requires users to undertake some basic precautionary activities\nregularly or while connecting to cyberspace. These activities include regular updating and\nmaintaining electronic devices, using passwords that follow security protocols, organizing the files\nstored on the device systematically, optimizing the device and software settings, and much more.\nThese steps ensure greater safety for individuals and hence, for their organizations too.\nThe government of India has made several efforts to strengthen cyber hygiene. This includes\nthe establishment of the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), which is the\nnational agency for incident response, including forecasting and mitigation for cybersecurity\nincidents. Its mandate includes monitoring and responding to cybersecurity incidents, issuing\nadvisories and guidelines, and promoting best practices in cybersecurity. Cyber Swachhta\nKendra (CSK) under CERT-In was established in collaboration with industry and academia to\ndetect systems infected by bots. In collaboration with Internet Service Providers and Industry\npartners, it notifies the end users regarding the infection of their system and provides them\nassistance in cleaning their systems. CSK also aims to enhance common users' awareness of\nbotnet and malware infections and measures to prevent them and secure their\ncomputers/systems/devices. The National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC) was set up to\ncoordinate the intelligence-gathering activities of other agencies and monitor metadata for\ncyber threat detection. NCCC intends to help the country deal with malicious cyber activities\nby acting as the first layer for cyber threat monitoring and communicating with Government\nand private service providers\nAdditionally, the government has focused on real-time reporting of cybercrimes, capacity\nbuilding of Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), and the implementation of the Crime and\nCriminal Tracking Network and System (CCTNS) in all police stations nationwide. The launch\nof 'CyTrain,' the world's largest cyber security training program, underscores India's\ncommitment to equipping citizens with cyber awareness and skills. These initiatives\ncollectively aim to fortify the nation's cyber infrastructure and enhance preparedness against\nevolving cyber threats.\nMinistry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Govt. of India launched\nG20-Stay Safe Online Campaign in December 2022 to raise awareness among citizens to stay\nsafe in the online world on the widespread use of social media platforms and rapid adoption of\ndigital payments. Detailed information is available at www.staysafeonline.in.\nThis handbook aims to provide a deeper understanding of the significance of digital hygiene\npractices in safeguarding your online presence and fostering a safer digital environment for all.\nThrough insights and guidance, it seeks to equip individuals with the knowledge and tools\nnecessary to navigate the digital realm securely and responsibly.\n2 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nFig. 1.1 Digital Hygiene (Source: IIPA)\n1.2 The Need for Digital Hygiene in the Education Sector\nThe COVID-19 outbreak resulted in an upsurge in the utilization of digital transformation in\nthe education environment in most schools and universities. Increased focus on smart devices\nreplaced conventional institutes with online classes. Digital transformation in the education sector\nconsists of teaching-learning processes such as online learning video interaction, learning from\naugmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR), gamification, and exam portals. These new tools\nprovide a platform for students and teachers to collaborate and conduct virtual sessions with the\nability to record, share, learn, and evaluate sessions at their convenience.\nThese digital tools save time, overcome location, and provide the ability for faculty and students to teach\nand learn almost anywhere, anytime. Whiteboards and smartboards are becoming a norm to make\nthe teaching-learning process truly interactive, particularly in the urban context. Some students\nand teachers now have access to smart mobile devices and related software and apps. The\nconvenience of online courses and certifications, as well as the availability of large digital resources\nwith micro-learning modules, have made them increasingly popular among students and educators\nworldwide as this model provides learners with various options at ease.\nThe trend of relying on digital technologies in the education sector will not slow down. Instead,\nit will further increase due to digitalization. Digitalization is the process of using new-age digital\ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), blockchain,\nand so on to maximize the use of the digital resources available. Applying new-age digital\ntechnologies also insists on modifying business models and eventually helps generate better\nvalue-producing opportunities.\nIt would, rather, transform further with the application of artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning (ML) technologies. For instance, instead of providing a single curriculum for all students,\neducators will be aided by AI, using the same basic curriculum to give a wide range of hyper-\npersonalized information tailored to each student’s individual needs. Many tech companies are\nnow focusing on the education industry, with purpose-built hardware, platforms, and digital tools to\nelevate the classroom learning experience. This trend of complete digital transformation in the\neducation sector is also referred to as ‘Edu-Tech.’\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 3\nAs per NCRB data, cybercrimes committed against children witnessed a sharp rise of more than 400\npercent in 2020 from those committed in 20191. A total of 842 instances of cybercrimes\ntargeting kids were reported in 2020, while in comparison, a total of 164 cybercrimes against\nchildren were reported in 2019, 413 percent lower than those in 2020. This could also be\nattributed to the fact that children are now spending more time on the internet for educational and\ncommunication purposes and, hence, have become more vulnerable to cyber threats.\nThe rapid acceptance of Edu-tech insists that educators and students should now proactively adopt\nprinciples of digital hygiene. However, before proceeding to understand the various Do’s and Don’ts\nof digital hygiene, elaborated in subsequent chapters, we shall understand some other related terms\nof digital hygiene. (We shall, henceforth, refer to all the associated stakeholders of the education\nsystem as only ‘educators.’)\n1.3 Some Other Related Terms\n1.3.1 Cyberspace\nCyberspace is a virtual environment of interconnected networks and digital systems to facilitate\ncommunication among various objects present in that network. Digital communication\namongst these systems is undertaken using computer network connectivity, the internet, etc.\n1.3.2 Surface Web\nThe Surface web, also called the White web, includes any public web content that is indexed by\nsearch engines. Web pages on the white web show up in the search results on sites like Google,\nBing, and so on.\n1.3.3 Deep Web\nDeep Web is a part of the internet that isn’t indexed by standard search engines such as Google\nSearch, Bing Search, Yahoo Search, AOL Search, etc., and hence, is not accessible (Fig.1.2).\nFor instance, private networks used by select businesses, governments, and educational institutions\nto communicate and regulate aspects of their internal operations are on the deep web.\n1.3.4 Dark Web2\nThe Dark Web is used to keep internet activity private and anonymous. It's a hidden collection\nof websites that can only be accessed with a specialized web browser, referred to as Tor, and it\nis not easily accessible through regular search engines like Google. It operates with layers of\nencryption, making it difficult to monitor. Because of its anonymity, the Dark Web has become\na hotspot for illegal activities, including selling drugs, firearms, and stolen data. Criminals use\nit to trade goods without getting caught. The Dark Web poses a serious threat to national\nsecurity because it enables illicit trading on a large scale.\n1 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1806602\n2 https://iica.nic.in/images/FOIRNews/The-Dark-Web-Cyber-Terrorism-Arindam.pdf\n4 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nDeep\nDark Web\nFig. 1.2 Overview of Surface Web, Deep Web, and Dark Web (Source: IIPA)\n1.3.5 Digital Footprints\nDigital footprints refer to the information available in cyberspace or on digital devices due to\nthe digital activities undertaken by an individual. These footprints are unique and traceable\ndigital activities. Actions such as liking posts on social media, browsing internet content,\nleaving web cookies on visited websites, and more, all contribute to digital footprints.\nImplementing the \"Right to be Forgotten\" or \"Right to be Erased\" is challenging due to the\npresence of digital footprints in cyberspace. Digital footprints are also known as 'digital\nshadows' in literature.\n1.3.6 Digital Inheritance\nDigital inheritance is the process by which a person's digital assets, such as online accounts,\nfiles, and media, are transferred to specific individuals or beneficiaries after the person's death.\nIt involves recognizing the existence of these digital assets and determining who has the right\nto access and use them after the individual passes away. This may include transferring access\nrights with beneficiaries and addressing the storage of these digital assets, which can be either\non the deceased person's own devices or under the control of third-party service providers\n1.3.7 Wire Frauds\nWire frauds are criminal acts or attempts to commit fraud with the aid of some form of electronic\ncommunication, e.g., telephone, internet, etc. Wire fraud may include a phone call, a fax, an email,\na text, or social media messaging, among many other forms.\n1.3.8 Cybercrime\nThe term \"cybercrime\" refers to criminal activities related to computers, information\ntechnology, the internet, and virtual reality. While there isn't a specific legal definition, it\nencompasses offences involving these technologies. Laws penalizing cybercrimes are found in\nvarious statutes and regulations, including the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the\nIndian Penal Code of 1860. Cybercrime involves any criminal activity conducted using\ncomputers, the internet, or other technology reconsigined by the Information Technology Act.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 5\n1.3.9 Data Breach\nA data breach occurs when unauthorized individuals, including insiders or external attackers,\naccess confidential or sensitive information stored in computer systems without proper\nauthorization. This can involve medical records, financial data, personally identifiable\ninformation, and more. According to the Information Technology Act, 2000, specifically\nsection 43A, if a body corporate possesses, handles, or deals with sensitive personal data or\ninformation and fails to implement and maintain reasonable security practices and procedures,\nthey are held responsible. Additionally, provisions in the Information Technology\n(Amendment) Act, 2008 address the protection of critical information infrastructure, the\nprivacy of information held in computer systems and networks, breach of confidentiality and\nprivacy, and penalties for such breaches.\n1.3.10 Data Recovery\nData recovery is the process of recovering data that has been lost, erased, corrupted, or rendered\nunavailable. The data is recovered from a backup copy kept in a different location. In case of data\nloss, the more current the backup copy is, the more completely the data can be restored. Successful\ndata recovery requires a backup and restore plan that specifies data recovery objectives, usually as\npart of a larger data loss recovery plan.\n1.3.11 Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity refers to the practice of safeguarding information, equipment, devices, computer\nsystems, communication devices, and the data stored within them from unauthorized access,\nuse, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. In essence, it involves protecting\nnetworks, devices, and data from malicious activities or criminal exploitation while ensuring\ninformation confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nFig. 1.3 Elements of Cybersecurity (Source: IIPA)\n1.3.12 Information Security\nInformation encompasses various data types, including personal details, social media profiles,\ncell phone data, biometrics, and more. The practice of safeguarding this data against\nunauthorized access, use, disruption, disclosure, alteration, inspection, recording, or destruction\n6 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nis termed as information security. Therefore, information security covers a broad spectrum of\nresearch fields, including cryptography, mobile computing, cyber forensics, and online social\nmedia, among others. Information security programs are constructed around three fundamental\nprinciples, commonly known as the CIA Triad:\n• Confidentiality: Ensuring protection against unauthorized access to data and systems.\n• Integrity: Ensuring protection against unauthorized changes or alterations to data.\n• Availability: Ensuring access to authorized users as and when required.\n1.3.13 Zero Trust Security\nThe Zero Trust Security model is based on three core aspects: verify every user, validate every device\nand transaction, and limit privileged access. In this, every identity is authenticated and authorized\nbefore access is granted. The core principle is “Never Trust, Always Verify.”\n1.3.14 Digital Forensics\nDigital forensics is a term that combines elements of law and computer science to analyze data and\nsecure data from computer systems, networks, wireless communications, and storage devices in a\nway that the information derived from them can be used as evidence in a court of law.\nDigital forensics not only examines and interprets the motivation of the crime and reconstructs\nthe evidence trail digitally but also identifies, collects, and analyzes the information found on\ncomputers, mobiles, and networks. They collect evidence of all types of crimes, such as murder,\nhuman trafficking, fraud, data theft, hacking attempts, drug dealing, or pedophiles.\nDigital forensics makes it possible to recover even deleted e-mails and evidence after formatting\nthe hard drive and investigating multiple users who have taken over the system.\nTherefore, digital forensics techniques are useful in national security-related activities,\nincluding catching up with hardened criminals or pinning down deadly instances/criminals\nresponsible for cyber espionage or cyber warfare.\n1.4 Why Do People Fall Victim to Cyber Crimes?\nIt is almost an accepted fact that there are only two categories of entities in cyberspace. The first\ncategory of entities is ‘who have already been hacked,’ and the other category is of those ‘who could\nbe hacked.’ Therefore, the biggest presumption that any entity can make in cyberspace is “I will\nnever be hacked.”\nIndividuals usually fall prey to cybercrimes, mainly for the following reasons:\n• Ignorance – Ignoring current cybercrime trends can cause a person to become a victim.\nHackers can spend months analyzing the loopholes in their victims' behavior and daily\nroutine and then exploit them. The technique of studying and exploiting human behavior\nfor cybercrime is also called the ‘social engineering’ technique. In this technique, the\nfraudsters usually use the digital users' ignorance and try to pick them up as a fraud.\n• Trusting strangers – Cybercriminals employ strategies and present themselves as genuine to\ninnocent victims. For example, hackers can have easy access to the company’s networks\nby sending e-mails wherein they pose as co-workers. Unknowingly gullible individuals could\ntrust such rogue individuals and, thus, end up providing sensitive information such as\npasswords and company credit card details to the hackers/rogue individuals.\nCybercriminals can also create a sense of urgency and take advantage of the confusion to\ndeceive the victims into giving their sensitive financial /personal information.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 7\n• Underestimating the risk – In certain instances, victims become overconfident and end\nup underestimating the potential risks of revealing too much of their sensitive personal\ninformation in cyberspace. They, thus, end up sharing their passwords /OTP /Pins /CVV\nnumbers with strangers or even with known ones.\n1.5 Why Do People Commit to Cyber Crimes?\nSimilarly, individuals or groups of individuals commit cybercrimes primarily for the following\nreasons:\n• Social Reasons: The internet is being highly used for social abuse and harassment. Social\nabuse and harassment are defined as repeated and unsolicited behaviour by a threat vector\nthrough cyberspace with the intent to intimidate, humiliate, threaten, harass, or stalk the\nuser. With the rapidly growing technology, internet users commit cybercrimes by engaging\nwith users on various social media platforms. A number of cyberattacks are committed to directly\nor indirectly affect cyberspace users of diverse age groups.\n• Financial Gains: The threat actors utilize various techniques within cyberspace to facilitate\ntheir money-making efforts. Frauds are committed with the motive of gaining financial\nbenefits. This occurs when someone steals one’s money. This can be accomplished through\nvarious means, including identity theft and investment fraud.\n• Cyber Espionage: Cyber espionage is an intrusion to get secret information about an\nindividual, an organization, or a nation. Cyber espionage is not an act of war but could be\nused as a tool to defeat the enemy state in a war. Some occurrences of cyber espionage could\ngenerate severe tensions between two nations and are therefore also frequently referred to as\n‘attacks.’\nBased on this basic understanding of human behaviour and plausible reasons for becoming cyber-\nvictims or cybercriminals, let us now try to understand the ‘Threat Landscape’3 of cybercrimes in\nthe following section.\n1.6 Threat Landscape of Cybercrimes\nThreat Landscape would provide us with an overview of who could be potential ‘Targets’ of\ncybercrime. The victims of cyberattacks are generally individuals, organizations, or nations. Threat\nLandscape also explains who could be various kinds of perpetrators of cybercrime, also referred\nto as ‘Threat Actors.’ It then moves on to explain ‘Motives’ or reasons why threat actors commit\na crime. Last but not least, the threat landscape also indicates what tools, referred to as ‘Attack\nVectors,’ are used by criminals (threat actors) to initiate a cybercrime (Fig 1.4).\n• Targets: The target/victim of any cybercrime could be an individual, an organization, or a\nnation.\n• Threat actors: The threat actors could be several. These could be professional cybercriminals,\nmalicious insiders, or hacker groups. Threat actors are constantly exploiting the ‘bugs’\nin hardware/applications and weaknesses or vulnerabilities in humans/digital users.\nIt is pertinent to note that in this handbook, the term ‘threat-actors' has been referred to by several\nof its related terms, including ‘fraudster,’ ‘scammer,’ ‘cybercriminal,’ ‘attacker,’ ‘hacker,’ ‘rogue\nactor’ and so on. These references have been made according to the context.\n3 https://egyankosh.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/91742/1/Block-5.pdf\n8 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n• Motives/Reasons: The motives for undertaking a cybercrime could be financial or for\nsheer amusement or to harass someone. Cyberattacks, generally, vary from an individual,\norganization, or nation by way of disruption of various services.\n• Attack Vectors: Attack vectors are the paths or means by which an attacker gains unauthorised\naccess to a computer system, network, or application to exploit vulnerabilities and carry out a cyber\nattack. Attack vectors can take various forms and exploit different weaknesses in a system's\ndefenses.\nFig. 1.4 Threat landscape (Source: IIPA)\n1.7 Understanding Attack Vectors\nNow, once we have understood some of the main reasons that threat actors commit or fall prey\nto a cybercrime along with essential aspects of the threat landscape, let us proceed to cover in\ndetail some of the basic tools that threat actors employ to commit a cybercrime. These ‘tools’ are\nalso called ‘Attack Vectors’. Various kinds of popular attack vectors are explained in the following\nsection.\n1.7.1 Social Engineering\nAs already explained earlier, social engineering techniques refer to the soft techniques that usually\ninclude psychological manipulation of the victim by the threat actors. As indicated in the previous\nsection, this manipulation could be done by calling them - pretending to be a potential job employer,\nor by sending an e-mail - pretending to be a co-worker. It can be undertaken through a voice call,\nvideo call, WhatsApp message, text message, or even an e-mail message to the potential victim in\na manner to induce feelings of urgency, fear, or other comparable emotions. All such tricks could\nprompt the victim to reveal sensitive information. He/she could also be provoked to click a harmful\nlink or open a malicious file. There are several social engineering toolkits that are freely available.\nThe Kali Linux operating system offers free social engineering toolkits like Maltego and Social\nEngineering Toolkit (SET).\n1.7.2 Malware\nMalware refers to programs such as viruses, worms, trojan horses, and rootkits that are designed\nto harm a computer/mobile/network device. Malware can get into the system in numerous\nways, such as through opening e-mail attachments that contain malware, downloading infected\nfiles while data sharing, clicking on links in an instant messenger or chat rooms, or from active\ncontent applications on web pages (Since malware is quite relevant, we explain it in detail in\nthe subsequent chapter).\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 9\n1.7.3 Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)4\nAn advanced persistent threat is a broad term to describe an attack in which an intruder,\nor team of intruders, establishes an illicit, long-term presence on a network/network device to\nextract highly sensitive data. APTs are usually sponsored by nations or very large organizations.\nBusinesses holding a large quantity of personally identifiable information are at high risk\nof being targeted by advanced persistent threats. They conduct research to identify previously\nunknown vulnerabilities and exploit those vulnerabilities to gain access to systems in an\nundetected manner.\nFor instance, Stuxnet, an APT, took down Iran's nuclear program. In 2010, U.S. and Israeli cyber forces\nattacked the Iranian nuclear program to slow down the country's ability to enrich uranium.\nIt is important to remember that this list of attack vectors explained herewith is not exhaustive.\nHowever, respecting the basic nature of this handbook, only some of the attack vectors have been\ncovered.\n1.8 Basics of Being Cyber Safe\nIrrespective of the nature of the attack or attacker, one could always minimize the damages of\ncybercrime if the basic do’s and don’ts, such as creating strong passwords, restricting access to\npersonal information, respecting the privacy of others, and many more, are kept in mind (may\nrefer Annexure at the end of the booklet).\nTable 1.1 General Digital Hygiene Tips (Do’s and Don’ts)\nGeneral Digital Hygiene Tips\nDo’s\n1. It is essential to adopt a rigorous “zero-trust” approach, which includes keeping the privacy\nsettings of all devices and apps stringent.\n2. Install all-important utilities on your digital devices, such as antivirus software,\nfirewalls, and virtual private networks (VPN helps to camouflage real IP addresses).\n3. Procure all-important utilities from authorized sources or authorized app stores only.\n4. Use well-designed passwords for your accounts, different for each account, or use\npassword managers.\n5. Alternatively, use hardware keys.\n6. Change all your passwords every month or use a password manager utility.\n7. Regularly update all your software.\n8. Switch off the Internet, Location, and Camera when not in use.\n9. Use only those trusted e-commerce websites that are accessible through HTTPS or\npadlock signs.\n10. Make sure that everything and everyone is verified before any access is granted to any\ninformation.\n4 https://informatics.nic.in/uploads/pdfs/fb12995f_36_37_tup_apt.pdf\n10 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nGeneral Digital Hygiene Tips\nDon’ts\n1. Do not expose personal details such as DoB, Date of Graduation, Parents’ Name on social\nmedia, or financial credentials such as PIN/CVV; hide them as much as possible as these details\ncould be easily manipulated for fabricating your identity by fraudsters or could lead to your\nlogin credentials.\n2. Do not react to spam e-mails or suspicious friend requests.\n3. Do not click on links that are accessible through unverified addresses.\n4. Do not install apps that come from unknown sources or are free.\n5. Do not fall for 'Free Offers' - if there is no/ less cost of the product,\n6. Do not grant unnecessary permissions to contacts/calendars/cameras to other apps that do not\nrequire it. For e.g., a cab-sharing app does not need to be given access to the camera and so\non.\n7. Do not click on the 'Remember Me' or 'Remember Password' options.\n8. Do not search for customer care numbers of your banks or utility service providers from\nyour browsers; instead, go to the source website/correspondence flyers to look for the same.\n9. Do not undertake financial transactions in free Wi-Fi/public Wi-Fi zones.\n10. It is advised not to keep any sensitive photographs/videos, or any personal document in your\nmobile phone’s storage. The personal documents may be Aadhaar cards, Voter IDs, PAN\ncards, Credit/Debit cards, private information on medical health, Income tax info., etc.\n11. Use of free internet in public places may be avoided, particularly for financial transactions, etc.\n12. There are issues particularly related to R&D Institutions, which may lead to data leakages,\npiracy issues, etc. The users must avoid the following:\ni. Open-source softwares freely available to convert doc to pdf, vice-versa, or to other formats,\nimage resize, format converters jpg, jpeg, png, etc.\nii. Online statistical/ mathematical tools, etc.\niii. Many open-source software are available for free use and are downloaded by users. These\nmay contain malicious codes (hidden segments) and could result in data theft.\niv. Use of storage services provided by many private companies like Amazon, Google,\nMicrosoft, IBM, etc. must be avoided.\nHowever, this list of do’s and don’ts is not exhaustive. We will uncover many more of these safety tips\nin the subsequent chapters.\n1.9 Be Cautious and Follow Internet Ethics\nInternet ethics are a set of moral principles that govern an individual or a group on acceptable\nbehaviour while using digital devices. One should always be honest and respect the rights and\nprivacy of others on the internet. Some of the basic rules that must be followed by an individual\nwhile using the internet include various caution points such as changing passwords regularly, never\nresponding to unknown people on the internet, never sharing personal information with anyone,\ntrusting information from genuine sources only, and much more (Fig. 1.5).\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 11\nFig. 1.5 Rules to follow, internet ethics (Source: ISEA Awareness portal)\n12 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nChapter 2: Malware and its Types\n2.1 Understanding Basics of Malware\nMalware refers to malicious apps that, upon installation, infect the victim's device with viruses or\nharmful scripts, etc. This could sabotage the smooth functioning of the device itself or collect user\ninformation such as GPS coordinates, contact lists, and so on. This collected user information could\nbe further shared with third parties who could misuse the same for their own/corporate\ngains.\nFor instance, Indian taxpayers were targeted by a malicious app impersonating 'ITR Mobile'.\nWhen unwittingly downloaded on the phone, the app requests permission to access Accessibility\nservices. If granted, it could monitor and capture sensitive information such as banking details,\nPAN number, Aadhaar number, address, date of birth, mobile number, and email address. This\nallows hackers to steal login IDs and passwords for internet banking. The app then transmits\nthese details to a third party, likely a fraudster, while displaying a fake update screen to deceive\nthe user.\nFig. 2.1 A case of a malicious app\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 13\n2.2 Types of Malware\n2.2.1 Virus\nA virus is a type of malware that duplicates itself by embedding its code into other programs.\nIt spreads via infected websites, USB drives, and emails by attaching to legitimate files or data.\nThe virus is triggered when the user opens the infected file or application. Once activated, it\ncan delete or encrypt files, modify programs, or impair system functions.\n2.2.2 Worm\nA worm is a type of malware that replicates itself and propagates automatically across a network. It\ntakes advantage of vulnerabilities in security software to steal sensitive data and install backdoors\n(which will be explained in the next section) that can be used to access the system, damage files,\nand cause other harm. Worms use up a lot of memory and take up a lot of bandwidth. As a result,\nservers, individual systems, and networks get overworked, go slow, and even crash in certain\ninstances.\n2.2.3 Trojan\nA Trojan horse, commonly referred to as a ‘Trojan,’ is harmful software that disguises itself as\nlegitimate but can take over a computer. Its purpose is to damage, disrupt, steal, or otherwise\ncompromise data or networks. To deceive users, a Trojan presents itself as a genuine\napplication or file. There is one unique feature of a Trojan. Viruses can execute and replicate,\nbut a Trojan cannot do so. Trojans must be executed by the user, and this is the reason they are\nattached to an executable file.\nFor instance, a person downloaded an executable file thinking of installing it as a game, but with it, a\nTrojan has also been attached. Once the person runs that Exe file, along with the game, the Trojan also\ngets installed on the device, and the attacker gets access to the device remotely.\n2.2.4 Backdoor\nA backdoor is a type of malicious software that grants unauthorized remote access to a device or\nprogram by exploiting system vulnerabilities and flaws. It operates stealthily in the background,\nkeeping the victim unaware. With full control over the system, the attacker can perform harmful\nactions undetected. The system becomes susceptible to unauthorized file copying, modification, data\ntheft, and many other things.\n2.2.5 Rootkits\nA rootkit is a type of software that enables hackers to access and control a device. While most rootkits\ntarget software and operating systems, some can also infect the hardware and firmware. Rootkits\nexcel at concealing their presence, remaining hidden yet fully operational, allowing unauthorized\naccess to the device. They enable hackers to carry out various malicious activities, such as stealing\nsensitive data and financial information, installing malware, or using the compromised device as part\nof a botnet (which will be explained in the next section) to send spam or engage in Distributed Denial\nof Service (DDoS) attacks.\n14 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n2.2.6 Bots and Botnets\nA bot is a software application designed to carry out automated, repetitive, and predefined tasks.\nCompanies and individuals employ bots to do repetitive activities that humans would otherwise\nperform. When compared to human effort, bot tasks are usually simple and completed at a\nconsiderably faster rate. Bots can perform useful functions, such as providing customer support or\nindexing search engines. However, they can also be malicious, used to gain full control over an\nunauthorized device (Fig. 2.2).\nFig. 2.2 Bots: Risks and Countermeasures (Source: ISEA Awareness portal)\nA botnet is a collection of internet-connected devices that individually run one or more bots,\nfrequently without the device owners’ knowledge. Malware bots and internet bots can be\nprogrammed to breach user accounts, search the internet for contact information, transmit spam, and\nperform other malicious activities. Attackers may deploy harmful bots in a botnet to carry out these\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 15\nactivities and hide the source of the activity. Like any other malware, bots, and botnets are\ndistributed and downloaded from social media or e-mail communications that provoke the victim to\nclick a link. A bot might show up as a warning stating that the device will be infected with a\nvirus if the user does not click on the connected link. By clicking the link, the user can infect the\ndevice with a virus that may damage the device in the following ways:\n• Unauthorized access - Unauthorised Access refers to unauthorized attempts to bypass the\nsecurity mechanisms of a computer/information system or network.\n• Data breach - A data breach occurs when malicious insiders or external attackers gain\nunauthorized access to confidential or sensitive information, such as medical records,\nfinancial data, or personally identifiable information (PII).\n• IoT attacks - IoT attacks include any cyberattacks that seek to gain access to (or control\nover) IoT devices with the intent to either cause harm to the devices or use them in attacks\nagainst other targets.\n2.2.7 Advanced Persistent Threat\nAn advanced persistent threat (APT) is a broad term used to describe an attack in which an intruder,\nor team of intruders, establishes an illicit, long-term presence on a network/network device to extract\nhighly sensitive data.\n2.2.8 Ransomware\nRansomware is a form of crypto-virological malware that restricts access to a victim's personal\ndata until a ransom is paid. While basic ransomware may only lock the system without harming\nfiles, more sophisticated versions employ a method known as cryptoviral extortion. This\ntechnique encrypts the victim's files, rendering them inaccessible, and requires a ransom\npayment for decryption.\nAttackers might target to lock systems or encrypt files of universities, government organizations, law\nfirms, or other organizations with sensitive data and easy security systems.\n2.2.9 Scareware\nScareware is a type of malicious software that deceives users into visiting fraudulent or malware-infected\nwebsites. Scareware may come in the form of pop-up ads that appear on the user’s device screen.\nScareware combines social engineering and fear tactics to force victims into purchasing and\ndownloading malware. Usually, the alerts indicate that infected files have been discovered on the\ndevice, and to resolve the issue, the victim must purchase the software. However, no infected files\nexist, and the suggested software is most likely malware.\nFig. 2.3 Scareware: A fake alert to scare off the victim\n16 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n2.2.10 Adware\nAdware is malicious software that displays unwanted pop-up advertisements which can appear on\na computer or mobile device. Such adware is usually downloaded along with software programs or\napps from the internet. Free software which contains some advertisements may be annoying but\nis not illegal. However, even if a third-party program adds malicious ad software onto a user’s device\nafter obtaining the user’s consent, it is illegal.\n2.2.11 Keylogger\nA keylogger is a type of malware that is especially challenging to detect. This software application\ntracks users' activities, providing hackers access to their personal information. By recording\nkeystrokes, it can uncover passwords, credit card information, and frequently visited websites. The\nprogram installed on the computer captures every keystroke made by the user. The log file is then\nsent to a server, where fraudsters await its use. One can enable the task manager to detect if a keylogger\nis active, which could detect all active and unknown applications. One can also do a full malware\nscan displaying the complete list of detected threats.\n2.3 Safety Tips to Prevent Malware\nSuch a long list of malware (which is still not exhaustive) could create unrest in the mind of any\ncasual reader, too. However, as listed below, some basic tips5 would go a long way to safeguard\nagainst major data/reputation loss.\nTable 2.1 Safety Tips to Prevent Malware (Do’s and Don’ts)\nSafety Tips to Prevent Malware\nDo’s\nC\n1. Exert all caution in mind before opening e-mail attachments or images, particularly if the\nsender is unknown/unreliable.\n2. Install anti-malware, antivirus software and applications only from authorized providers/\nsources such as Play Store, App Store, or the company’s official website.\n3. Download files only from trusted sources. Avoid downloading attachments from unknown\nsenders or clicking on suspicious links, even if they come from seemingly familiar sources.\n4. Keep your operating system and software updated with the latest security patches. Most\nsystems have built-in firewalls, so make sure they are enabled.\n5. Regularly backing up your important files allows you to restore them in case of a malware\nattack.\n5 https://egyankosh.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/91742/1/Block-5.pdf\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 17\nSafety Tips to Prevent Malware\nDon’ts\n1. Avoid logging into personal or professional accounts, such as email or banking, when\nconnected to a public Wi-Fi network.\n2. Don't open attachments from unknown senders or emails that appear suspicious.\n3. Avoid visiting websites known for distributing malware, such as illegal downloading sites.\n4. Security software is there to protect you, so don't disable it.\n5. Pirated software often comes bundled with malware, so avoid using it. Stick to legitimate\nsources for your software.\n2.4 How to Cure a Malware Infected Device\nOne could try the following checklist to de-infect the device.\n1. If the slightest sign of infection (such as the device misbehaving, going slow, restarting\nrepeatedly, etc.), one should first disinfect the device with an authentic antivirus.\n2. Simultaneously, the victim could proceed to change all the passwords.\n3. If a pop-up stays on the screen longer than usual, the browser can be closed by pressing Ctrl\n+ Alt + Delete on the keyboard. Minor malware infection is usually resolved by rebooting the\ndevice.\n4. As soon as there is any suspicion of infection, the victim should disconnect the device from\nthe internet to avoid any further infection. This is very helpful in cases where the fraudster\ncould have left a remote access trojan on the victim's device to reconnect it to his device\nremotely.\n5. The last and the safest (but not the easiest) resort is to format the hard drive and install a\nclean operating system.\n6. If the device is still malfunctioning, it would be most logical to take it to an authorized service\nprovider or Cyber-Swachhta Kendra (https://www.csk.gov.in/about.html) of the Government\nof India or make use of the M-Kavach 2 mobile app (explained in detail in a later chapter).\nThe 'Cyber Swachhta Kendra' (CSK) is managed by the Indian Computer Emergency Response\nTeam (“CERT-In”) as part of the Government of India's Digital India program to detect and\nremove botnet infections across the country. (Fig. 2.4).\n18 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n(Fig. 2.4 Home page of Cyber-Swachhta Kendras (https://www.csk.gov.in/about.html)\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 19\nChapter 3: Some Popular Types of Cyber Crimes\nNow that our basics have been established, let us cover some of the more popular types of\ncybercrimes that have been trending in recent times.\n3.1 Phishing6\nA phishing attack is a tactic to deceive individuals into revealing confidential information through\nemail, SMS, or WhatsApp.These sources usually contain a hyperlink text or a spurious link. When\nthe victim unwittingly clicks on this link, he/she either downloads malware or unwittingly shares\ntheir sensitive personal details. It involves acquiring or attempting to obtain sensitive banking\ninformation, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. Phishing e-mails and SMS\nmessages try to confuse the victim in several ways by sending messages that sound urgent. These\nmessages may include alerts about unusual activity or attempted logins, requests to update payment\ninformation, and similar prompts. They might also ask users to verify personal details, send\nfraudulent invoices, require payment through a link, claim eligibility for a government refund, or\noffer coupons for free items.\n3.1.1 E-mail Phishing\nEmail phishing seeks to obtain confidential information by sending messages that look like they\ncome from a trusted source. This type of attack is not targeted and can be executed on a large scale.\nThe sender expects the user to click on the link given in the e-mail and share some personal details,\nintimidating them that their account is prone to unauthorized activity.\n3.1.2 Spear Phishing/Whaling\nSpear phishing entails sending emails or messages to specific individuals while pretending to be a\ntrusted sender to convince them to share personal information or money or to compromise their\ndigital devices. Unlike typical phishing attacks, spear phishing is highly focused and carefully\nresearched, primarily aimed at business executives, public figures, and other high-value targets.\n3.1.3 Vishing\nVishing, or voice phishing, occurs when a malicious caller impersonates a technical support or\ncustomer service representative, a government agency, or another organization to obtain\nsensitive information, such as banking or credit card details, via phone calls or voice messages\n(Fig. 3.1).\nAny call from an unfamiliar number can pose a risk to the recipient, particularly those from\nphone numbers with two or three digits that start with the prefix “+.”\n3.1.4 Smishing\nSmishing, often known as SMS phishing, is a cyberattack carried over mobile text messages. It\noccurs across various mobile text messaging platforms, including non-SMS channels such as data-\nbased mobile messaging apps. Victims are tricked into providing crucial information to a fraudster\nthrough malware or fraudulent websites.\n6 https://incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/report-phishing.aspx\n20 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n3.1.5 Pharming\nPharming is a deceptive cyber-attack that combines elements of farming and phishing. In this\nfraudulent scheme, cybercriminals install malicious code on a victim’s computer or server,\noften through a bogus website. The victim is then directed to this fake website, where they may\nunwittingly provide personal information such as usernames and passwords. The attacker gains\nimmediate access to this sensitive data. Pharming attacks exploit vulnerabilities in DNS\n(Domain Name System) servers, which are responsible for converting domain names into IP\naddresses. These attacks can occur by exploiting weaknesses in DNS server software or by\naltering the host’s file on the victim’s computer. Ultimately, cybercriminals intentionally\nredirect users to counterfeit versions of legitimate websites, aiming to steal their credentials.\nPharming is a cunning online trick. It's when illicit actors send real internet traffic to fake\nwebsites. These fake sites look real and try to steal important things like usernames, passwords,\nand bank details from people. Sometimes, they even put harmful software on your computer.\nOne way they do this is called the 'Watering Hole Attack.' It's like waiting at a popular spot\nwhere lots of people go. These actors find out which websites a group of people often visit and\nput malicious content on those sites. When people from that group visit those sites, they get\ncaught in the trap without knowing it. To do this trick, these actors first spy on what websites\npeople like to visit. It's a cunning trick called 'social engineering' to figure out the best places\nto set up their trap.\nTable 3.1 Safety Tips for Prevention from Phishing Attacks (Do’s and Don’ts)\nSafety Tips\nDo’s\n1. Verify the sender's identity: Always verify the identity of the sender or caller before\nproviding any personal or sensitive information.\n2. Be cautious of links and attachments: Take care when clicking on links or\ndownloading attachments from emails, SMS messages, or other sources,\nparticularly if they seem suspicious or unexpected.\n3. Use secure communication channels: Whenever possible, use secure communication\nchannels, such as encrypted emails or secure messaging apps, to exchange sensitive\ninformation.\n4. Enable security features: Enable security features such as email filters, spam\ndetection, two-factor authentication, and encryption to enhance protection against\ncyber threats.\n5. Stay informed and educate others: Keep up-to-date on the latest cybersecurity threats and\nonline safety best practices. Share this knowledge with others in your household or\norganization to help them recognize and respond to potential threats effectively.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 21\nSafety Tips\nDon’ts\n1. Trust blindly: Avoid blindly trusting emails, phone calls, or messages from unknown or\nunverified sources, especially if they request personal or financial information or urge urgent\naction.\n2. Provide personal information: Refrain from providing personal or sensitive\ninformation, such as passwords, Social Security numbers, or financial details, via\nemail, phone, or other communication channels unless you can verify the\nlegitimacy of the request.\n3. Click on suspicious links: Avoid clicking on links or responding to messages that\ncontain suspicious or unexpected content, as they could lead to phishing websites,\nmalware infections, or other cyber threats.\n4. Ignore security warnings: Take security warnings seriously, especially those issued\nby your web browser, email service provider, or antivirus software, and avoid\nignoring or dismissing them without further investigation.\n5. Neglect software updates: Regularly update your operating system, web browser,\nantivirus software, and other applications to patch security vulnerabilities and\nprotect against known cyber threats.\n3.2 Identity/Credential Theft\nIdentity theft is the act of obtaining some other person's personal information (PI), particularly\npersonally identifiable information (PII), personal sensitive information (PSI), or personal\nconfidential information (PCI) without their permission (Fig 3.1). Let us try to understand the\ndifference between these similar and yet very different terms.\nThe term ‘personal information’ (PI) refers to a wide variety of information, including, but not\nlimited to, one or more of the following categories (Table 3.1):\nTable 3.2 Types of Personal Information (PI)\nS.No. Type of Personal Information (PI)\n1. Information or opinion about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin\n2. Individual’s political opinion\n3. Individual’s religious beliefs\n4. Information or opinion about an individual’s sexual orientation\n5. Criminal records\n6. Health information (medical records)\n7. Credit information\n8. Employee record information (subject to exemptions)\n9. Tax file number information\n10. Digital ID information (IP addresses, login IDs, passwords, cookie identifiers)\n22 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nThis personal information could have various aspects, which are identity-related, sensitive, and\nconfidential.\n• Personally identifiable information (PII) is any information that identifies or describes an\nindividual. Identifying an individual could be as simple as a name or a number or include\ndigital identifiers such as an IP address, cookie identifier, or login credentials.\n• Personal sensitive information (PSI) would include information or opinions about an\nindividual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religious beliefs, sexual orientation,\nor criminal records. This definition varies from country to country.\n• Confidential information is the information that the user decides to keep secret. For instance,\nif a user wants to keep her phone number a secret, then it is confidential; otherwise, it is\nnot. Confidential information is also called ‘classified information’ because it is classified as\nconfidential for some reasons only known to the user. Personal confidential information (PCI)\nmay contain a person’s phone number, address, bank account number, Aadhaar number,\ncredit/debit card number, and passwords.\nThese discussions clearly reveal that personal information can lead to the disclosure of one’s financial\ndetails, medical records, and other critical personal records. Therefore, it is crucial to keep personal\ninformation secure to prevent identity theft.\nIdentity theft occurs through access to social media accounts, personal documents, or skimming\nof credit/debit cards, and so on. Identity theft can be carried out by using various cybercrime\ntechniques like social engineering, phishing attacks, and malware. Identity theft allows threat\nvectors to impersonate another individual to carry out various kinds of fraud, including identity\nfraud, financial fraud, social media crimes, and many others.\nFig. 3.1 Identity theft: The need to hide personal information (Source: CDAC)\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 23\nFig 3.2 Tips to Prevent Identity Theft (Do’s and Don’ts)\n3.2.1 Shoulder Surfing\nShoulder surfing is done to obtain personal data such as PIN, passwords, and other sensitive\ninformation by secretly watching a target, usually over their shoulder. Thus, they observe the\nkeystrokes or listen to sensitive information sent by the victim or by spying through overhead\nCCTV cameras, critically positioned over their keyboards, entering a pin at a cash machine/ATM,\nwhile filling a form, or while paying with a credit card. Shoulder surfing is an effective strategy\nfor obtaining personal information, particularly in crowded areas where the victim is observed.\nShoulder surfing also happens when the fraudsters install a reading device, such as a skim reader on\nan ATM to steal information.\n24 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nFig. 3.3 Shoulder surfing: Carelessness of victims leads to financial loss (Source: IIPA)\nTable 3.3 Safety Tips to Prevent Shoulder Surfing (Do’s and Don’ts)\nSafety Tips to Prevent Shoulder Surfing\nDo’s\n1. Install a privacy filter that allows only the person sitting directly in front of the screen to\nsee the screen.\n2. Use a password manager to create a strong password. It also consolidates all your passwords\nin one location.\n3. Use biometric authentication as much as possible, such as - Facial recognition or\nfingerprint authentication, to minimize the need to input a PIN/password.\n4. Pay attention to people standing close by in public places, especially when using ATMs,\nkiosks, or your phone for financial transactions.\nSafety Tips to Prevent Shoulder Surfing\nDon’ts\n1. Don’t leave the computer system unattended in any public space.\n2. Avoid the temptation to write down your passwords on sticky notes or easily accessible\nlocations.\n3. Refrain from talking aloud about passwords, PINs, or other confidential details while in\npublic areas.\n4. Public computers may contain malware that can capture your keystrokes. Avoid using them\nfor anything sensitive, like online banking.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 25\n3.2.2 Identity Frauds\nIdentity fraud happens when the stolen identity is used to commit various frauds, such as wrongfully\ngaining access to various resources, services, or goods.\nInstances of such fraud include opening a bank account, obtaining credit cards, purchasing goods, applying\nfor loans, committing offline crimes including murder, theft, etc., applying for jobs, or obtaining legal\ndocuments such as passports or licenses under a stolen identity.\n3.2.3 Spoofing\nSpoofing happens when threat actors attempt to conceal their true identities. They typically\nachieve this by impersonating a trusted partner or organization, misleading the recipient into\nbelieving the message is from someone else. Spoofing aims to unlawfully obtain sensitive\ninformation from the recipient, steal their login credentials (username and password), spread\nmalware, and more.\nFor example, this can involve spoofing caller ID or the phone numbers displayed on incoming\ncalls and text messages that appear to come from a targeted organization or individual.\n3.2.4 Impersonation\nImpersonation is a deceptive technique used to acquire basic credentials by posing as someone\nelse. In this scheme, a malicious actor assumes the identity of another individual to illicitly\naccess resources, credit, or privileges associated with that individual. While akin to spoofing,\nimpersonation has distinct characteristics. Spoofing entails attempting to send communications\nfrom the exact user or company being targeted, whereas impersonation involves crafting\ncommunications that appear to be from the targeted user or company, though they originate\nfrom elsewhere.\nLegally, \"cheating by personation\" occurs when an individual deceives others by assuming the\nidentity of someone else, knowingly substituting one person for another, or misrepresenting\nthemselves or another person as someone they are not. This offence applies regardless of\nwhether the impersonated person is actual or fictitious.\nIllustrations: (a) A deceives others by posing as a wealthy banker with the same name. This\nconstitutes cheating by personation. (b) A deceives others by assuming the identity of B, a\ndeceased individual. This also qualifies as cheating by personation.\n3.2.4.1 Digital Arrest\n'Digital Arrest Scam' is a latest modus operandi of cyber criminals where fraudsters impersonate\npolice, CBI, or other government officials and falsely accuse victims of serious crimes, such as\nfinancial fraud, drug trafficking, or tax evasion. The aim of these criminals is to use fear and\nemotional pressure to extort money from their victims.\nThis scam typically starts with an unexpected phone call finally leading to a video call from\nsomeone posing as an official from a government agency. The criminals threaten immediate\narrest to instill fear and compel the victim to act quickly. The victim is kept on the call for an\nextended period to prevent them from seeking help or verifying the information. Hence the\nname 'Digital Arrest'. The ultimate goal of the scam is to extort money from the victim.\nIf you get such suspicious call, report the number or source to 'Report & Check Suspect' section\nof cybercrime.gov.in\nIf you fall victim to this cybercrime report it by calling on 1930 or logging\ninto cybercrime.gov.in\n26 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nFig. 3.4 Impersonation: Cheating in examination using a mobile phone (Source: IIPA)\nFig. 3.5 Impersonation: Celebrity account hacked (Source: IIPA)\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 27\n3.2.5 Application Frauds\nApplication fraud happens when a criminal uses stolen or fake documents to open an account in\nsomeone else’s name. Criminals may try to steal documents such as utility bills and bank statements\nto build up useful personal information.\nFig. 3.6 Application frauds: Accused procured 500 SIM cards using forged papers (Source: IIPA)\nTable 3.4 Safety Tips to Prevent Shoulder Surfing (Do’s and Don’ts)\nSafety tips to Prevent Application Frauds\nDo’s\n1. Monitor financial statements: Consistently review your bank statements, credit reports, and\nother financial accounts for unauthorized transactions or unusual activity.\n2. Create strong passwords: Create robust and unique passwords for your online accounts, and\nactivate two-factor authentication whenever possible to enhance security.\n3. Verify sender's identity: Verify the identity of email senders or callers by asking for additional\ninformation or contacting the organization directly using verified contact details.\n4. Be cautious of requests: Exercise caution with requests for personal information, financial\ntransactions, or changes to account details, especially if they come from individuals claiming\nto be representatives of legitimate organizations or authorities.\n5. Review application details: Thoroughly review the details of any applications for loans, credit\ncards, or other financial products before submitting them, ensuring accuracy and\ncompleteness.\n6. Protect personal documents: Safeguard personal documents, such as identification cards,\npassports, and financial statements, to prevent unauthorized access or misuse by fraudsters.\n7. Enable email authentication: Enable email authentication protocols such as SPF (Sender\nPolicy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) to help detect and prevent\nemail spoofing attacks.\n28 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nSafety tips to Prevent Application Frauds\nDon’ts\n1. Share personal information: Avoid sharing sensitive personal information, such as Social\nSecurity numbers or bank account details, with unknown or untrusted individuals or\norganizations.\n2. Click on suspicious links: Refrain from clicking on links in emails or messages that request\npersonal information or direct you to unfamiliar websites, as they could be phishing attempts\nor malicious websites designed to steal your identity.\n3. Trust caller ID or email addresses: Do not trust caller ID or email addresses alone, as they\ncan be easily spoofed by attackers to appear as legitimate sources.\n4. Blindly trust requests: Avoid blindly trusting requests for personal or financial information\nfrom unknown or unverified sources, as they could be impersonation attempts aimed at\ndeceiving you into disclosing sensitive data.\n5. Share confidential information: Refrain from sharing confidential or sensitive information\nwith individuals or entities whose identities you cannot verify, especially if they request it\nvia unsolicited emails, phone calls, or messages.\n6. Provide false information: Avoid providing false or misleading information on applications\nfor financial products, as this could constitute fraud and lead to legal consequences.\n7. Fall for promises of easy credit: Be wary of offers for guaranteed approval or unusually low-\ninterest rates, as they could be signs of fraudulent schemes aimed at luring unsuspecting\nindividuals into application frauds.\n3.3 Misinformation/Disinformation\nDisinformation refers to the deliberate dissemination of misleading or biased information, often\nrooted in distorted narratives or facts, to serve a propaganda agenda. In contrast,\nmisinformation is false information shared unintentionally, regardless of whether the intent is\nto deceive.\n3.3.1 Fake Messages\nScammers often impersonate trusted individuals or institutions, crafting personalized messages\nto deceive their targets. To enhance the credibility of these messages, they frequently gather\npersonal information from social media or compromised accounts(Fig. 3.6).\nThe cybercrime unit of the Delhi Police has issued a warning regarding a potential scam where\ncriminals are tricking unsuspecting users into verifying their phone numbers under the pretense\nof Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. A tweet from the cybercrime unit indicates that\nscammers are sending fraudulent messages claiming that users' SIM cards will be deactivated\nif they fail to contact the phone numbers included in the message.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 29\nFig. 3.7 An example of a fake message on WhatsApp (Source: PIB)\n3.2.4 Fake News\nFake news refers to misinformation/ disinformation that is spread to mislead or deceive others. It\ncan be spread through various digital platforms in the form of videos, audio, messages, or\nadvertisements. Cyber fraudsters share such fake news to make money, promote ideas or beliefs\nabout specific organizations or companies, trick or exploit people, promote personal opinions, etc.\nFree recharge on COVID-19 vaccine - \"As India commemorates the COVID-19 vaccination\nmilestone, the government is granting three months of free recharge.\" the fake message stated. “If you click\nthe link below, your phone will be recharged. The offer is only available until December 20.\" The viral\nmessage included a URL to take advantage of the deal. The fact-checking unit of the Press Information\nBureau later confirmed that the government had not made such a declaration with a tweet, \"Do not\ndisclose or forward any of your personal information on any such bogus message's link.\"\n30 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nFig. 3.8 Fake news: Misinformation/disinformation by an online news channel (Source: IIPA)\nLet us now understand how an internet user spots fake news (Fig. 3.8):\n• Is there a bias? - One can check for bias by evaluating the story to see if the author tried to\nget any information to tell their side of the story. This demonstrates their credibility and\ntransparency in telling the story. One should search other media outlets to see what else is\nsaid about the story.\n• What is the date of the news? - Some deceptive sites take stories or pictures from a few years\nago and manipulate them to fit in a headline with recent events.\n• How did you come across it? - One should identify whether the source of news is valid.\nIt shouldn’t come from people who just read the headline and share information. If it is a\nwebsite, one should check the URL and look for inconsistencies such as spelling errors.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 31\nFig. 3.9 Tips on How to Spot Fake News\n(Source: https://repository.ifla.org/handle/123456789/167)\n3.2.5 Deepfakes\nDeepfakes are complex audio, video, or images that are created using artificial intelligence (AI)\nalgorithms based on ‘deep learning’ techniques (refer to glossary to know what ‘Deep learning’\nis). Deepfake audio, videos, and GIFs can rapidly disseminate false statements and actions to a\nworldwide audience, making it challenging to distinguish them from authentic information.7\nIn early 2020, a bank manager received a call from a man whose voice he recognized as the director\nof a company with whom he had spoken and worked before. He told the bank manager that his company\nwas about to acquire, so he needed the bank to authorize some transfers of around INR 35 million.\nBelieving everything was legitimate, the manager approved and initiated the transfer. What he didn’t\nrealise was that the transfer was going straight into the accounts of the criminals.\n7 https://egyankosh.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/91742/1/Block-5.pdf\n32 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n3.2.6 Fake Websites\nScammers create fake websites that mimic well-known brands or mobile phone companies,\npromoting products at unusually low prices. They deceive unsuspecting customers into making\nonline payments, only for the items never to arrive.\nOne tactic involves a false website offering a free high-value item with any purchase exceeding\na certain amount. After the buyer completes the transaction, they receive a call from the\nwebsite's supposed customer service, asking for a refundable fee for shipping, service, GST,\nand other costs related to the free item. This leads unsuspecting online shoppers to deposit\nthousands of rupees into the scammers' bank accounts.\nTable 3.5 Safety Tips to Prevent Misinformation/Disinformation (Do’s and Don’ts)\nSafety Tips (Misinformation/Disinformation)\nDo’s\n1. Check for spelling errors in the sender's address, the company's domain, or the URL, as well\nas grammatical mistakes in the main body of the email. Often, a popular website's name could\nbe masqueraded by a name that sounds or appears similar.\n2. Verify the authenticity of a message before sharing it on social media platforms.\n3. Trust those news items that are from authorized or authenticated sources.\nSafety Tips to Prevent Misinformation/Disinformation\nDon’ts\n1. Don’t take phone calls or reply to messages from unknown sources.\n2. Sharing something unverified can spread misinformation further. Take a moment to check\nbefore hitting that share button.\nFig. 3.10 Cyber Tip to Protect Oneself from Fake News (Source: MHA)\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 33\nFig. 3.11 Quick Tips to Keep Digital Data Private, Safe, and Secure (Source: MHA)\nFig. 3.12 Poster Warning People of ‘Free Online Offers’ (Source: ISEA Awareness portal)\n34 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n3.4 Financial Frauds\n3.4.1 Internet Banking-related Frauds\nAll banking services are now accessible online, including viewing account statements,\ntransferring funds, requesting chequebooks, and issuing demand drafts, among others. As the\nnumber of services available online increases, the incidence of cyber fraud in the financial\nsector is also rising\n3.4.2 UPI Frauds\nScammers often use a common tactic to deceive individuals by sending a payment request\nthrough their UPI app, making it easy for them to transfer funds. Once the payment request is\naccepted, the UPI app asks users for their PIN as the final step. If a person enters their UPI\nPIN, they risk losing all their money.\nFig 3.13 Best Practices for Unified Payment Interface (UPI)8\n8 https://www.csk.gov.in/tips/csp_12feb_1.png\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 35\n3.4.3 OTP Frauds\nVictims get SMS messages from fraudsters impersonating non-banking financial companies\n(NBFCs) offering loans or enhancement of credit limit and are asked to contact the fraudster’s\nmobile number. When the victims call the number, the fraudsters ask them to fill out a few forms\n(even online) asking for financial details, etc. They also incite/convince them to share the OTP or\nPIN details, eventually resulting in a loss of money.\nThe OTP fraud can also happen after the person has been a victim of a social engineering attack\nwhere he/she is prompted to give their financial details to the attacker via email, and the attacker\ninitiates a transaction from the victim’s bank account details and further convinces the victim to\nshare their OTP.\n3.4.4 E-Wallet Frauds\nThe Reserve Bank of India has recently made KYC (Know Your Customer) mandatory for mobile\nwallet users, but fraudsters have exploited this requirement. Typically, a victim receives a text\nmessage stating that their e-wallet needs KYC verification and instructs them to call a provided\nphone number to check their e-wallet status. The scammers often request a nominal transfer (like\nINR 1) as part of the process. While the customer is entering their password or PIN for the transfer,\nthe fraudsters gather information through various means, including a screen-sharing app that the\nvictim unknowingly downloads. This gives the scammers access to the victim's wallet credentials.\nThey can then transfer funds to other accounts using separate transactions, as the bank account is\nlinked to the victim's phone.\nMany network service providers are warning users not to fall for KYC-related messages, clarifying\nthat they do not ask for personal information through calls or texts.\n3.4.5 Credit/Debit Card Frauds\nFraud involving credit and debit cards is becoming increasingly common and continually evolving.\nCredit/debit card fraud refers to the unauthorized use of a card or similar payment method—such as\nautomated clearing house (ACH) payments, exchange-traded funds (ETF), or recurring charges—\nto illegally acquire money or property. Scammers may either physically steal the cards or obtain\ncard information through phishing links or card skimming techniques, subsequently using this\ninformation to make payments or withdraw funds from bank accounts.\n3.4.6 QR Code-related Frauds9\nOnline transactions have become a new norm, particularly after the recent pandemic. However,\none must be careful while carrying out transactions online. A quick response code, commonly\nknown as a QR code, is a type of barcode that holds information horizontally and vertically. It\nhas the account details embedded to transfer money to a particular account.\nCyber fraudsters impersonate potential customers and contact the person trying to sell a product on\napplications like OLX, Quikr, etc., and then agree to pay the price asked for the said well. The fraudsters\nclaim that they can neither come to take the delivery physically nor can they pay in cash. Therefore, they need\nto make payments online. They then send a fake QR code to scan to receive money. However, once the\nseller scans the QR code, it gets debited from the seller's account instead of the amount being credited.\nThe fraudsters can even access the seller’s bank account and steal all the money through multiple\ntransactions.\n9 https://www.cert- in.org.in/s2cMainServlet?pageid=PUBVLNOTES02&VLCODE=CIAD-2017- 0055\n36 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n3.4.7 E-Commerce Frauds\nE-commerce frauds are financial cybercrime that involves illegal transactions performed on an\ne-Commerce platform by a fraudster. The fraudster would use stolen payment information for\nonline transactions without the account owner’s knowledge. It can be done by using either a false\nidentity, stolen credit card, or fake card.\n3.4.8 SIM Swap Frauds\nSIM swap refers to the process of changing mobile SIM cards associated with registered phone\nnumbers. A SIM swap scam, often called a port-out scam, involves tactics like SIM splitting\nand SIM jacking. When this occurs without the user’s consent, it is typically for fraudulent\npurposes.\nFraudsters carry out this scam by obtaining a new SIM card from the telecom service provider\nlinked to the victim’s phone number. They may use various methods to achieve this, including\ngathering information from the victim’s social media profiles (known as open-source\nintelligence or OSINT), phishing, or impersonating a telecom customer service representative.\nBy posing as the user, they can easily obtain a new SIM card and deactivate the old one.\nConsequently, one-time passwords (OTPs) will no longer be sent to the original SIM, preventing\nthe user from receiving alerts for any financial transactions related to their linked bank account.\nInstead, fraudsters receive OTPs and other notifications on the new SIM, allowing them to\ncommit financial fraud against the victim’s accounts.\nFig. 3.14 SIM Swap Frauds: A Businessman Loses INR 18 Lakhs (Source: IIPA)\n3.4.9 SIM Cloning\nThis involves creating a duplicate SIM from the original using any software tool/ utility. It is\nmore sophisticated than SIM swapping. It is done to access victims’ International Mobile\nSubscriber Identity (IMSI) and encryption keys, which are used to identify and authenticate\nsubscribers on mobile telephony. Cloning the SIM will enable the fraudster to take control and\ntrack, monitor, listen to calls, make calls, and send texts using the mobile number.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 37\n3.4.10 DEMAT/Depository Frauds\nThe safeguarding of shares and securities in India falls under the purview of two depositories, CDSL\nand NSDL. However, these depositories do not interact directly with Demat account holders.\nInstead, they provide Depository Participant (DP) licenses to stockbrokers and intermediaries,\nenabling customers to open Demat accounts. In cases of DEMAT or depository fraud, brokers have\nbeen known to transfer exchange-traded fund (ETF) units without the investors' consent, using them\nas collateral for margin funds in trades.\n3.4.11 Cryptocurrency Frauds\nCryptocurrencies are anonymous digital tokens that can be traded for goods and services online.\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies has led to the emergence of related sectors, such as cryptocurrency\nIRAs (individual retirement accounts) and digital wallet providers. However, due to their rapid\ntransaction capabilities, portability, and global accessibility, cryptocurrencies can also be\nexploited for illegal activities like tax evasion, money laundering, and bribery. Fraudsters may\nattempt to manipulate cryptocurrency markets and similar derivative assets through tactics such\nas spoofing for improper market manipulation or engaging in crypto-jacking and giveaway\nscams.\n• Crypto-jacking refers to a type of cybercrime in which hackers hijack individuals' electronic\ndevices—such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and servers—to mine for bitcoin without\ntheir consent. This unauthorized mining process can significantly slow down the CPU\nperformance of the affected devices and lead to increased electricity consumption while\nprocessing data.\n• Giveaway scams are also common cryptocurrency cyberattacks. The hackers pretend to be\nwell-known investors or even celebrities who offer assistance to tiny investors. When the\nvictim transfers their cryptocurrency, however, instead of expanding their own investment,\nthe money goes directly into the hands of the scammer.\n• Fake crypto wallets: Fraudsters may also set up counterfeit crypto wallets, enabling them to\nsteal funds from unsuspecting victims. They can create these fake wallets to deceive users, as\nwell as establish fraudulent crypto exchanges to take money from clients.\nCryptocurrency frauds are usually done by the ‘pump and dump’ strategy where the value of an asset\nis ‘pumped’ dramatically through false and misleading statements, only to be ‘dumped’ afterward as\nthe price falls. This strategy is illegal as the dramatic ‘pump’ of the asset is often induced by a\nfraudster who has purchased the asset at a lower price.\n38 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nFig. 3.15 Cryptocurrency Frauds (Source: SoK: Crypotjacking Malware – arXiv)\nFig. 3.16 Cryptocurrency frauds: jac and Dump (Source: IIPA)\n(Source: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/SoK%3A-Cryptojacking-Malware)\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 39\n3.4.12 Criminals Doing Frauds Exploiting ‘Fear of Missing Out-FOMO’\nThe fear of missing out (FOMO) is related to the fear of missing out on a profitable investment.\nSome frauds are committed by triggering this type of fear. The fraudsters make bold claims about\nthe high returns one might expect and time limits on the investment, thereby encouraging\nthe victims to part with their money without thinking it through. Fraudsters exploit the rising\npopularity of digital assets like cryptocurrencies, bitcoins, initial coin offerings, etc., to trap\ninnocent investors in scams, often leading to devastating losses. Given the rise in the price of some\ndigital assets in recent years, some investors may have FOMO, thinking that they might miss\nan opportunity to become wealthy. FOMO is not the only thing that can influence one’s\nfinancial decisions. Often social media, headlines, news, or advertisements can be misleading.\nIf one makes an investment without evaluating the financial offer, one can end up losing a huge\nsum of money.\nFig. 3.17 A case study on the fear of missing out (FOMO) in online gaming (Source: IIPA)\nFor instance, the value of a crypto coin called Enzyme was falling in the crypto economy, but then\nsomething unusual happened. According to CoinGecko, the price of Enzyme, also known as Melon\n(MLN), jumped from INR 30 to INR 47 in just minutes, while daily trading volumes jumped from\nINR 3 million to over INR 100 million. It then dropped to INR 35 after a few hours. The coin had\njust been ‘pumped and dumped’ as the scammers conspired to inflate the price to benefit quickly.\n40 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n3.4.13 Side-Channel Attacks\nSide-channel attacks aim to gather private information from a vulnerable system so that it may\ndisrupt the system. For instance, such attacks could ‘discover’ the information leaks of a vulnerable\nsystem to ‘break’ into the cryptography of a system to disrupt it.\nSince side-channel attacks rely on the relationship between leaked information and private data,\nsuch attacks could be prevented/minimised if the following points are taken care of:\n1. One should try to eliminate or reduce the release of such information.\n2. Given the relationship between the two, one should try to unrelate the leaked information\nto the private data through some kind of randomization of the cipher text that transforms\nthe data in a way that can be undone after the cryptographic operation is completed.\nTable 3.6 Safety Tips to Prevent Financial Frauds (Do’s and Don’ts)\nSafety Tips to Prevent Financial Frauds\nDo’s\n1.

Do not scan the QR code if you have to receive money.\n3.5 Man-in-the-Middle\nMan-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks happen when an attacker intercepts communications\nbetween two parties by intruding and eavesdropping on their exchanges. In these attacks, the\n\"targets\" are typically an individual and a service. The attacker may remain undetected during\nthe communication, secretly stealing credentials and modifying emails or other messages to\nfacilitate cybercrime using the acquired information.\n10 https://egyankosh.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/91742/1/Block-5.pdf\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 41\n3.5.1 Juice Jacking\nA cyberattack in which an infected USB charging station is used to compromise linked devices is\nknown as juice jacking. Juice jacking is a Man in the Middle (MitM) attack that targets hardware.\nIn this technique, a mobile device’s power is delivered over a USB cable that is also used to transfer\ndata. The attacker uses a USB connection to load malware directly onto the charging station. In some\ncases, a connection cable is plugged in so that someone would come along and use the\n‘forgotten’ cable. This usually happens at airports, shopping malls, and other public areas\nproviding free mobile device charging stations.\nFig. 3.18 Juice Jacking: Free Charging Station Debited INR 50,000 & More (Source: IIPA)\nFig. 3.19 Juice Jacking: Personal Data Stolen at the Public Charging Station (Source: IIPA)\n42 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nFig 3.20 Juice Jacking: Safety Tips11\n3.6 Social Media Crimes\nAcross the globe, mobile devices dominate in terms of the total minutes spent online.

Sometimes, it promotes notions\nlike inadequacy of life and experiences, fear of missing out –FOMO (covered in the previous\nsection under ‘financial frauds’), depression and anxiety, and defamation, which greatly impacts\nthe mental health of the users.\n‘Cyber defamation’ is a broad term that refers to any online or cyberspace act, deed, word, gesture,\nor thing that has the intention of defaming a person’s reputation or goodwill so that others in the\ncommunity - whether they are online or offline - will view them with disrespect, ridicule, hatred,\ndisinterest, or with a negative quality. It can be committed via email, mailing lists, bulletin boards,\nthe internet, discussion forums, and the World Wide Web.\n3.6.1 Cyberstalking\nA cyberstalker harasses or stalks victims through digital devices or the internet. This can involve\nusing email, instant messaging, online messages, discussion forums, or other electronic\ncommunication methods. In many cases, the stalker remains unknown.12\n3.6.2 Cyberbullying\nCyberbullying refers to bullying that occurs through digital technology, aimed at instilling\nconfusion, fear, or shame in the victim. The bully posts unpleasant, damaging, or threatening\ninformation about the victim on social media or other platforms, such as blogs, gaming apps,\netc.\nFig. 3.22 Tips on Cyberbullying for Young Children (Source: @CyberDost, MHA)\n12 https://egyankosh.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/91742/1/Block-5.pdf\n44 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n3.6.3 Sexting\nSexting is the act of sending or sharing sexually provocative text messages and images, including\nnude or semi-nude photos, via digital devices. This can occur through hacking, where images are\ntaken from the original recipient and shared without the sender’s consent, or when a previously\ntrusted individual misuses that trust. When such images are distributed without the victim's approval,\nsexting becomes problematic, and the victim is considered a target of cybercrime.\n3.6.4 Honey Trapping13\nHoney trapping is an act of using romantic or intimate relationships for interpersonal, political, or\nfinancial reasons to obtain sensitive information. It can compromise the safety of the individual and,\nsometimes, the nation’s security as well. Attackers exploit the closeness of a relationship to\nmanipulate or blackmail their victims. Today, this is mainly done through social media platforms,\nalthough the term was originally used in a non-digital context. One such concept is \"pig butchering,\"\nwhere scammers use romantic relationships on dating apps and social media to entice individuals\ninto investing in cryptocurrency and gold. This highlights how various types of fraud can be closely\nlinked; for instance, social media scams can lead to cryptocurrency fraud and vice versa.\nWhat is a ‘pig-butchering’ crypto scam\nwhere do fraudsters use romance to lure people?\nFraudsters are using the Chinese-origin ‘pig-butchering’ technique, a\nreference to how a target is “fattened up” before being butchered, for\ncryptocurrency scams. They develop long-term romantic relationships\nwith targets on dating apps and social media to make them interested\nin cryptocurrency, forex and gold investments. They introduce the\ntarget to a sham investment website or app they control.\nFig. 3.23 Pig butchering crypto scam (Source: In shorts)\n3.6.5 Sextortion\nSextortion is a cybercrime that occurs when a fraudster threatens a victim to share private and\nsensitive information, usually sexually explicit images, particularly to extort money or sexual favors\nfrom the victim. The fraudster may also threaten the victim to use information obtained from her/\nhis device that could harm the victim’s friends or relatives, in case the victim doesn’t comply with\nthe demands of the fraudster.\nNowadays, sextortion email scams are also a common threat.

Once they have fully gained the victim's trust,\nthey propose marriage and pressure them to transfer money to their accounts, citing an emergency.\nAfter receiving the payments, the fraudsters vanish and move on to their next target.\n3.12 Career frauds\nNowadays, many individuals seek job opportunities online. In cases of career-related fraud,\nscammers present fake job offers from well-known companies, claiming to hold senior\npositions there. They then request money transfers from victims under the guise of job\nregistration fees. It can be challenging for people to determine the legitimacy of these offers,\nmaking them susceptible to falling for these fraudulent job schemes\nTable 3.11 Safety Tips to Prevent Matrimonial and Career Frauds (Do’s and Don’ts)\nSafety Tips to Prevent Matrimonial and Career Frauds\nDo’s\n1.

In India, there are several channels available to file a\ncybercrime complaint.\n• The government of India has also provided cyber-cells in almost all the states (list available at\nhttps://cyber crime.gov.in/Webform/Crime_NodalGrivanceList.aspx).\n• One could also call the National Helpline number ‘1930’ (24*7) for immediate reporting\nof Cyber Financial Frauds.\n• The victim could lodge a cyber-complaint on the national portal “cyber crime.gov.in”.\n• The conventional measure is to report on the National Emergency Response number of ‘112’.\n• The victim could also lodge the FIR with the local police station. The victim (or the well-\nwisher of the victim - who is lodging the complaint on behalf of the victim) must\nremember a zero FIR could be lodged from any police station. Usually, cybercrime is\ntreated as a cognizable offence, whereby a police officer can be arrested without any arrest\nwarrant.\nIn the next subsection, one shall also find a cue card of steps on how to do so. A summary of steps\nfor filing online cyber-complaint is presented herewith (Fig 4.1).\nC\nFig 4.1 How to File a Cyber Crime Complaint (Source: IIPA)\n52 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n4.1.1 Registering Complaints through an E-mail to State Cyber Nodal Officers\nApart from resorting to the channels mentioned above (Fig 4.1), a victim could also register a cyber-\ncomplaint by emailing the complaint directly to the designated Cyber Nodal Officer of the state. As\nalready mentioned above, almost every state has local cyber cells monitored by Cyber Nodal\nOfficers. A PDF file with the list of email IDs and contact numbers of the nodal officers is\navailable in the ‘Contact Us’ section on the national cybercrime portal cybercrime.gov.in.\nThe direct link to access the details of Cyber Nodal officers is https://cyber\ncrime.gov.in/Webform/Crime_NodalGrivanceList.aspx. This link could be used to access the email\nof the respective Cyber Nodal Officer of the state to whom the cyber-complaint is to be addressed.\n4.1.2 Registering Complaint by Women and Children Victims\nSpecial helpline numbers and portals are available for women and children to lodge a\ncybercrime complaint, as summarized herewith.\ni. Helpline and Portal for Women Victims -\n• Helpline numbers when the victim is a Woman: ‘1091’ or ‘181’\n• Portal to lodge a complaint with the National Commission for Women (NCW):\nncw. nic. in\nii. Helpline and Portal for Children Victims -\n• Helpline number when the Victim is a Child: ‘1098’\n• Helpline number by DCPCR (Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights)\n+91-9311551393\niii. Emergency Helpline number, in case of obscene calls/ online stalking - 1096/1090\niv. E-mail for women or children Victims: They could also email their cyber-complaint to an\nemail address of the Ministry of Women and Child Development: mwcd@gov.in.\n• Cyber complaints by women/children victims could be lodged by their well-\nwishers. All such complaints could be “anonymous,” too, and even these investigations\ncould be undertaken anonymously, too, if requested.\n4.1.3 Registering Complaint of Cyber-Financial Frauds\nSpecial remedial measures are particularly available if financial fraud is committed\n(Fig 4.2).\n1. The customer must file a complaint or notify her bank regarding the fraud through the\nbank’s Customer Care Phone number, E-mail, or written complaint mentioning the details\nof the fraud.\n2. The complaint or notification should be submitted within three days to ensure that the\ncustomer has no liability.\n3. It is also advisable to file a police complaint regarding financial fraud.\n4. If the fraud is related to a credit/debit card, then the customer should contact the Bank’s\ncustomer service and get the card blocked immediately to avoid any further misuse of the\ncard.\n5. The bank is required to reverse or refund the amount within ten working days from the\ndate the customer notifies them, provided the customer has zero or limited liability.\n6. If loss/fraud was due to the negligence of the customer, then the bank is not liable to provide\nany refund to the customer.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 53\n7. If the Customer is not satisfied with the resolution provided by the Bank, then she can file\na complaint with RBI’s banking ombudsman (https://cms.rbi.org.in/cms/ IndexPage.aspx)\nFig 4.2 Steps to Follow to File a Complaint, In Case of Financial Frauds (Source: IIPA)\n4.1.4 Reporting to a Bank in Case of a Financial Fraud\nFig. 4.3 An Example of Financial Fraud Complaint through E-mail\n54 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nFig. 4.4 Banks Defeat the ‘Zero Liability Policy’ to the E-mail Complaints\nDRAFT\nFig. 4.5 When and How to Approach an RBI Banking Ombudsman (Source: IIPA)\n4.1.4.1 Measures to be taken when an individual loses their mobile phone:\n1. Call the cell phone from a different device. One can also sound an alert by using the carrier’s\nmobile app to override ringtone settings.\n2. If the phone’s text messages are enabled to appear on the lock or home screen, leave a text\nwith contact information in case someone finds it.\n3. Each phone has built-in security settings. One can monitor, ring, lock, or wipe the phone\nremotely using the ‘find my phone’ feature if it is enabled.\n4. If a person is quite convinced that the phone has been stolen, one should wipe the data\nfrom it remotely as quickly as possible to keep personal information safe.\n5. If one cannot find the phone fast, use the ‘find my phone’ option on the phone to lock it\nremotely from anywhere. Also, just in case, change the passwords on all accounts, including\nfinancial accounts, emails, and social media.\n6. Block the phone’s IMEI by any of the following means:\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 55\nTo report a lost or stolen phone, follow these steps on the website: https://www.ceir.gov.in/:\nFile a Police Report: Ensure you keep a copy of the report\na. Obtain a Duplicate SIM Card: Contact your telecom service provider (e.g., Airtel, Jio,\nVodafone/Idea, BSNL, MTNL) for a duplicate SIM for the lost number. This is necessary as\nyou'll need it as your primary mobile number (where the OTP will be sent) when submitting\nyour request to block the IMEI.\nNote: According to TRAI regulations, SMS functionality on reissued SIMs will be activated 24 hours\nafter the SIM is activated.\nb. Prepare Required Documents: Gather a copy of the police report and proof of your identity.\nYou may also include the invoice from the mobile purchase.\nc. Fill Out the Request Registration Form: Complete the form to block the IMEI of your\nlost or stolen phone and attach the necessary documents.\nd. Submit the Form: After submission, you will receive a Request ID, which can be used\nto check the status of your request and to unblock the IMEI later.\ne. Contact Your Network Service Provider: Contact your provider through their official\ncustomer service channels. They can disable the phone's service, making it inaccessible\neven if someone uses a new SIM card or changes operators.\nf. File a First Information Report (FIR): Report the incident at your nearest police\nstation. This step is crucial, as it can help you contest any fraudulent charges made using\nyour device, even if you do not recover the phone.\nFig. 4.6 Steps to Follow in Case of a Lost Mobile Phone (Source: IIPA)\n4.1.5 Reporting Cyber Abuse on Social Media Platforms\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, social media users sometimes misuse the platforms to abuse,\ncreating an inappropriate environment. A feature called ‘Report or Mark as Spam’ is available\nto users in such cases. This feature allows them to report channels, posts, profiles, comments, or\nother content if it violates the norms or harms another person’s sentiments (Fig. 4.7). The platform\ninitiates appropriate action in accordance with EULA.\n56 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nThe government notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital\nMedia Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (“IT Rules, 2021”) on 25.02.2021, which was subsequently\namended on 28.10.2022 and 6.4.2023. The IT Rules 2021 cast specific legal obligations on\nintermediaries, including social media intermediaries and platforms, to ensure their\naccountability towards safe & trusted Internet, including their expeditious action towards\nremoval of prohibited misinformation and patently false information.\nReporting Cyber Abuse on Social Media Platforms, including Intermediary (\"Intermediary\" in the\ncontext of electronic records refers to any entity that handles, stores, transmits, or provides services\nrelated to such records on behalf of another. This encompasses telecom service providers, network\nservice providers, internet service providers, web hosting companies, search engines, online payment\nplatforms, auction websites, e-commerce marketplaces, and cyber cafes. Social media platforms can\nsometimes foster misuse and abuse, leading to an inappropriate environment. To counteract this, users\nare equipped with a 'Report or Mark as Spam' feature to report channels, posts, profiles, comments, or\nother content that breaches norms or harms sentiments. The platform will then take appropriate action\nin accordance with the End User License Agreement (EULA), along with applicable rules, regulations,\nprivacy policies, and user agreements, all provided in a language chosen by the user.\nKey Obligations for Intermediaries in Addressing Cyber Abuse:\na. Due Diligence by Intermediaries:\n Intermediaries are required to meet specific due diligence standards, particularly for social\nmedia and online gaming platforms.\n They must clearly display their rules, regulations, privacy policies, and user agreements in the\nuser's chosen language.\n Users should be warned against hosting, displaying, uploading, modifying, or sharing\nprohibited content, such as unauthorized material, obscene or harassing content, and harmful\ncontent for children.\n Intermediaries are responsible for regularly updating users about these regulations.\n Upon becoming aware of illegal content, intermediaries must quickly remove or\ndisable access to it, retain the relevant information for investigation, and assist authorized\ngovernment agencies.\nb. Other Obligations of Intermediaries:\n Maintain user data for a designated period after account cancellation or withdrawal.\n Implement appropriate security practices and procedures.\n Report cybersecurity incidents and share information with the Indian Computer Emergency\nResponse Team.\n Ensure their services are accessible while upholding due diligence, privacy, and transparency.\n Before hosting or charging for online games, they must confirm registration with the relevant\nself-regulatory organization.\n Respect the constitutional rights granted to citizens.\n These provisions are designed to increase accountability and transparency in\naddressing cybercrime on social media and online gaming platforms.\nc. Grievance Redressal Mechanism for Intermediaries:\nProminent Display of Grievance Officer Details:\n• Intermediaries must prominently feature the name and contact details of the Grievance\nOfficer on their website or mobile app, enabling users to report rule violations or other\nissues related to the intermediary's resources.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 57\nd. Handling of Complaints by Grievance Officer:\n The Grievance Officer must acknowledge complaints within twenty-four hours.\n Complaints must be resolved within fifteen days, except for specific cases related\nto removing certain types of content, which must be resolved within seventy-two\nhours.\n The Grievance Officer is responsible for receiving and acknowledging orders,\nnotices, or directions from the Appropriate Government, competent authorities, or\ncourts.\nWithin twenty-four hours of receiving a complaint regarding prima facie offensive content,\nthe intermediary must take reasonable measures to remove or disable access to such content.\nReporting Cyber Crime Online\nFig. 4.7 Reporting Cyber Crime Online (Source: IIPA)\n4.2 Lodging a Cyber Crime Complaint on the National Cyber-Crime\nPortal\nAs one can see from these discussions, the Government of India has provided numerous mechanisms to report a\ncyber-crime in India; however, it would be most prudent to file it on the web portal of cybercrime.gov.in, which is a\ncentralized portal by the Government of India (GoI). A National Cybercrime portal has been\nestablished to integrate and centralize information related to all Cyber Crime cases across India. This\nportal now saves the hassle of physically going to a police station. So, reporting the cyber-crime on\nthis portal would be good enough. The status of the cybercrime report can also be tracked through\nthe portal by providing the necessary information, such as the Acknowledgment number of the\ncomplaint and the registered phone number/login ID. While reporting a cybercrime on the portal\n“cyber crime.gov.in,” there is an option to select the particular State/UT. If this option is exercised,\nthen the complaint details will be automatically sent to the concerned State Police. However, in\ncase of any emergency or if an FIR has to be filed immediately, then the local Police Station can\nalso be approached for the same.\na) To file a complaint on the centralized portal of the Government of India\n(cybercrime.gov.in), one can take cues from the steps mentioned below.\nStep 1 - Open the web-portal https://cybercrime.gov.in/ (Fig. 4.8)\n58 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nStep 2 - On the homepage of the portal, the victim would find multiple tabs to access. Next to the\nhome tab, there are two other tabs, viz. Report Women/Child-Related Crime and Report Other\nCyber Crime.\nStep 3 - To report a women/child-related cybercrime, the victim can click on the ‘Report Women/\nChild-Related Crime’ tab. Following this step, a drop-down menu with two options will appear.\n- ‘Report Anonymously’ or ‘Report & Track a Complaint.’\nStep 4 - The victim can select the ‘Report Anonymously’ tab if the victim does not want to reveal\nher/his identity. The cybercrime report would be filed anonymously on the portal without any\nregistration (i.e., without collecting the victim's personal information such as email ID, mobile\nnumber, etc.).\nStep 5 - The victim has to then click on the ‘File a complaint’ tab followed by the ‘I accept’ tab to\nreport a cybercrime. The victim must read all the conditions carefully and then accept them.\nFig. 4.8 Portal for Filing a Complaint (Source: National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal)\nStep 6 - Fill in the complaint and incident details as asked in the following form. Once the form is\ncompleted, the victim has to click on the ‘Save & Next’ tab to move to the next part of the report.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 59\nFig.4.9 Cyber Crime Complaint Form to Report Anonymously (Source:\nNational Cyber Crime Reporting Portal)\nStep 7 - These details would be followed by the suspect details, if any. After clicking on the ‘Save &\nNext’ tab, the victim can preview the form and re-check all the details entered in the report.\nStep 8 - Finally, the victim has to submit the report by clicking the ‘Submit’ tab on the screen.\nStep 9 - However, if the victim selects the ‘Report & Track’ tab, a box to enter the citizen login\ndetails appears on the screen where the victim would be asked to fill in the state in which the crime\noccurred along with personal information such as a login ID (same as the email ID of the victim)\nand mobile number of the victim.\nFig. 4.10 Registering a New User on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal\nStep 10 - The victim would receive an OTP on the registered mobile number and then, the victim\ncan report the crime on the portal. After successfully logging in, the victim can choose the respective\narea of cybercrime and register a complaint.\n60 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nStep 11 - The victim would be asked to fill in the relevant details of the cyber-crime.\nStep 12 - However, if the victim selects the ‘Report Other Cybercrimes’ tab on the homepage,\nthe victim will directly reach the page with the ‘File a Complaint’ tab. From here onwards, the\nvictim must follow the same steps as above in the ‘Report Anonymously’ tab.\nb) Tracking the Complaint Status on the National Cyber-Crime Portal\nStep 1 - As soon as the victim has registered a complaint on the cybercrime portal, the victim\nwill receive an acknowledgment number on the login ID and the registered mobile number to\ntrack the status of the complaint. All further communication regarding the investigation will be\ndone through the victim's registered mobile number/login ID.\nStep 2 - The victim would click on the ‘Report and Track’ tab to check the status of the cyber\ncomplaint. The complaint status can be tracked through the given acknowledgment number and\nan OTP that would be generated as the victim enters the portal.\nStep 3 - The victim would enter the login ID, the mobile number, the OTP, and the captcha.\nAs the victim clicks on the ‘Submit’ tab, the victim would receive the following screen with\nthe status of the complaint updated by the police and the date on which the action was taken\n(Fig. 4.11).\nFig. 4.11 To track the complaint status (Source: National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal)\n4.3 To Register Complaint if an Organization’s Website is Hacked\nIn the cyber domain, identifying the individual responsible for the website hacking can be a\nchallenging task, as many hackers conceal their tracks by using a VPN, Proxy, or Tor network, or\nsometimes the attack may be launched from another compromised machine. However, the IP\nAddress from where the hack was perpetuated can be identified by analyzing the Web server logs\nand its configuration files, Logs of perimeter devices like Firewall, IPS/IDS, Network devices,\nApplication logs, Operating System Logs, User Activity Logs, etc. This information can be further\nused by Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) to investigate further and identify the suspect.\nThe case can be reported to –\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 61\n• Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) - To report a website hacking incident\nto I4C, India's central cybercrime agency established by MHA, the complaint can be\nreregistered at cybercrime.gov.in with sufficient evidence of the complaint for swift\naction. Accuracy is crucial for I4C's specialized teams to respond promptly, enhancing\nnational-level coordination against cyber threats.\n• Cybersecurity Govt. Agencies (“CERT-In”/NCIIPC/NIC-CERT) - The complaint of\nwebsite hacking of a government organization should also be made to “CERT-In”\n(incident@ cert-in.org.in) and National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre\n(NCIIPC) (ir@nciipc.gov.in) if the site or its infrastructure or data has been officially\nnotified as a Critical Infrastructure. If the site is hosted in NIC’s Data Centre, then it should\nbe reported to NIC-CERT (incident@nic-cert.nic.in).\n• Local Police Station - A formal complaint can be submitted to the local SHO, along with\nscreenshots of defaced websites and whatever technical/ related details are available.\n• CBI - CBI should also be reported for the central government website. An email can be\nsent to (speou9del@cbi.gov.in) detailing the case along with the related artifacts/evidence/\nscreenshots. However, we still need to check whether there are any regulatory requirements\nfor reporting a hacking incident to CBI.\nOrganizational Support for Incident Reporting and Support (“CERT-In”/NCIIPC)\na. “CERT-In” and NCIIPC can help in the analysis of logs/firewall/IP to know who hacked the\nwebsite. They are well equipped with state-of-the-art tools for the same. They also have a\ncyber forensic wing for further analysis.\nb. However, the organization must share all logs (Web server logs/firewall/IDS/IP routers and\nswitches), the network diagrammatic scheme, and the website setup.\nc. Once the incident is registered; an incident number will be generated and shared.\nd. Once the incident gets resolved, the enquiring agency (“CERT-In”/NCIIPC) will provide\nthe Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and close the case.\n(“CERT-In” toll-free number: 1800-11-4949; email: incident@cert-in.org)\n4.4 Preventive Measures\n“It is better to be safe than sorry” - runs an old adage. By taking some basic precautions, it would\nalways be wiser to safeguard the endpoints - the digital devices in the users’ hands. Some of the very\npopular preventive measures are safeguarding digital devices by installing anti-virus software\n(preferably more than one), installing firewalls, and so on.\n4.4.1 Install Antivirus Software\nAntivirus software is a type of application that is meant to prevent, detect, and eradicate malware\nattacks on individual computing devices, networks, and information technology systems. Antivirus\nsoftware, which was initially meant to identify and remove viruses from computers, can now guard\ndigital devices against a wide range of threats, including keyloggers, browser hijackers, trojan\nhorses, worms, rootkits, spyware, adware, botnets, ransomware, and many more.\nAn antivirus software typically initiates a scan when a new device is started or plugged into the\nmain system. Some antivirus software does this automatically in the background, while others warn\nusers of infestations and prompt them to delete the files. Antivirus software is typically granted\nprivileged access to the whole system to undertake all these activities. As a result, antivirus software\nin itself is also a frequent target for attackers. Hence, it is absolutely necessary to get reputed and\n62 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nreliable antivirus software and update it regularly from its official site as the company comes out\nwith patches against the latest discovered vulnerabilities. For the same reasons, many cyber experts\ninsist on loading more than one anti-virus software on your device so that if one fails, the other\none is still there to protect the device.\n4.4.2 Install a Firewall\nWhen the user’s device, particularly a PC, is accessible through an internet connection or Wi-Fi\nnetwork, it is prone to a cyber threat. However, one could restrict outside access to one’s computer\nwith a firewall. A firewall is a network security mechanism that monitors all incoming and\noutgoing traffic and allows, rejects, or drops that specific traffic depending on a predetermined set\nof security rules. The firewall checks network traffic against the rule set defined in its table. Firewalls are\ntypically configured to block data from unknown or suspicious locations, such as certain IP\nAddresses or certain devices/ports while allowing the authorized devices to get connected to the\nprotected device/network.\nHardware firewalls come as separate devices. In an in-home/small office environment, routers from\ncertain vendors could also include some of the relevant firewall features. In the software version,\nthe majority of the firewalls come pre-configured to block malicious traffic.\nIn a similar context, a virtual private network (VPN) is another commonly used tool. It is a service\nthat enables the user to maintain privacy online. A VPN creates a private channel for data and\ncommunications while the user utilizes public networks, establishing a secure, encrypted\nconnection between the digital device and the internet.\nDigital device users may also require a copy protection device (explained in the Glossary). A\nhardware key, also called a \"dongle,\" is a type of software copy protection device that can be\nplugged into the USB port of a digital device. The application scans for a key as soon as the device\nis switched on, and it only activates if the key has the right code. A hardware key is used mostly\nwith high-priced software. Since hardware keys are hard to replicate, they offer very effective copy\nprotection.\nHowever, a word of caution - Firewalls do not guarantee that malware will not attack the computer.\nIt only protects against malware.\nTherefore, to assure full protection the user must install a firewall in conjunction with other\nantivirus software to stay completely safeguarded.\n4.4.3 Create Strong Passwords\nPasswords are essential ‘locks’ to safeguard a user’s social media account, bank login, Wi-Fi access,\nand so on. Passwords act as a deterrent against cyber attackers who may try to gain unauthorized\naccess to the accounts or devices to steal the data. Therefore, storing all the passwords in a\nsecure place is very important. For the same reason, one should have a very strong password that\nshould be difficult to crack and update frequently.\n1. Characteristics of Weak Passwords:\ni. Passwords that contain fewer than ten characters.\nii. Passwords that are dictionary words (in any language).\niii. Passwords that are common terms, including names of family members, pets, friends,\ncolleagues, or characters from movies, novels, or comics, as well as computer-related\nterminology and names of websites, companies, or software.\niv. Passwords that include birthdays or other personal details, such as addresses and phone\nnumbers.\nv. Patterns of letters or numbers, like \"123456,\" \"aaaaa,\" \"qwerty,\" \"asdfg,\" or \"zxcvb.\"\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 63\n2. Tips for Creating Strong Passwords:\ni. A robust password should incorporate letters, numbers, special characters, and\nuppercase letters. One effective method is to substitute letters with numbers and\nsymbols, such as changing “i” to “!”, “o” to “0,” and “s” to “$.” For example, the\nsimple term “Microsoft” can be transformed into the much more secure “M!cr0$0ft.”\nii. Password length is crucial; longer passwords are more difficult to crack.\niii. Consider using a memorable sentence and taking the first letter of each word to create\na complex password that is easy to remember.\nFor instance, the sentence “My Name is Dinesh Anandan, and I was born on 1 January 1986!”\ncan generate the password “MNiDAaIwbo1J1986!”, which is lengthy, includes numbers,\nspecial characters, and uppercase letters, making it both memorable and unlikely to appear in\na dictionary.\nIf one tends to forget passwords for different accounts, using a password manager to remember them\nis better. These password managers are readymade apps/utilities to create, manage, and store\npasswords. Many popular service providers have proprietary password managers that help generate\nstrong, unique passwords for all accounts, such as bank accounts, social media, etc.\nBenefits of using a password manager\n1. The user would no longer need to remember all the passwords.\n2. Password managers can generate safe passwords for the user automatically.\n3. Password managers can warn the user about a phishing website.\n4. Password managers are time savers.\n5. Password managers can sync across many operating systems. They aid in the protection of user\nidentity.\nIf a task involves sharing passwords, such as when sending a password for an encrypted file attached\nto an email, it should be communicated through a separate channel, like a phone call or SMS.\nTable 4.1 Tips for Creating Strong Passwords (Do’s and Don’ts)\nTips to Create Strong Passwords\nDo’s\n1. Create a strong password with at least ten characters, incorporating a mix of letters, numbers, and\nsymbols.\n2. Change all the passwords of email, computer, etc., periodically, at least once every\nmonth.\n3. Treat passwords as sensitive information.\n4. Use unique passwords for each login account. Sharing passwords across multiple\naccounts increases the risk of exposure if any site is compromised.\n5. When you need to share passwords, such as for an encrypted file sent via email, do so through\na different channel, like a phone call or SMS.\n6. Avoid clicking at the prompt of the “Remember Password” feature whenever it is\nprompted by various browsers/apps.\n64 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nTips to Create Strong Passwords\nDon’ts\n1. Do not save passwords in browsers in an easily readable format, nor write them down\non devices, whiteboards, office notice boards, or any other places where unauthorized\nindividuals could find them. If you need to share passwords, use a separate method of\ncommunication, such as a phone call or SMS.\nFig. 4.12 Tips to Protect Password\n4.4.4 Switch-On Incognito Mode\nAll major online browsers have a function that allows the user to open a private browsing window\nthat deletes the browsing history when closed. It’s known as “Incognito Mode,” “Private Browsing,”\nor “InPrivate Browsing,” depending on the browser being used. When a user browses privately in\nIncognito mode, Chrome doesn’t save the browsing history, cookies, site data, or information\nentered online.\nHow to go to Incognito mode while browsing -\n1. Open Chrome on your computer.\n2. Click \"More\" in the top right corner, then select \"New Incognito Window.\"\n3. A new window appears. In the top corner, check for the Incognito icon .\nOR\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 65\nUsers can also use a keyboard shortcut to open an Incognito window -\n1. Windows, Linux, or Chrome OS: Press Ctrl + Shift + n.\n2. Mac: Press + Shift + n.\nFig. 4.13 How to Switch on the Incognito Mode\nAfter selecting the “New incognito window” option, one can see in Fig. 4.13 that one will get the\nblack screen and clearly see the incognito sign “ ”.Refer to the following Fig. 4.14.\nFig.4.14 Device Screen, as the User Switches on the Incognito Mode\n66 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nFollowing are a few advantages of using private/Incognito mode while browsing the Internet:\n• Deletes cookies: Cookies are commonly used to provide users with a more targeted and\ncustomized browsing experience. Cookie Service providers, track these cookies and\ncompile users’ online behavior and preferences to personalize the browsing activity. However,\nif these cookies get hacked and land up with rogue actors, these could be misused to hack\ninto the user's personal information.\nTherefore, a user should ideally browse in Incognito mode. When a user logs out with\nIncognito Mode enabled, the browser will automatically remove these cookies, keeping the\npersonal settings hidden from these service providers/web portals.\n• Keep browsing history private: If a person needs to check their email or shop online on\na public computer, there’s a possibility that the device would save the browser history. This\nimplies that the next person who logs on to the same device can also see all of the websites\nvisited by the previous user and even get into them using their credentials.\n• Incognito Mode prevents this kind of undesirable ‘visibility’ of browsing history by removing\nany temporary browser data as soon as the person logs out.\n• Enables multiple sessions: It allows people to log into multiple accounts at the same\ntime. For example, a person may use an Incognito window to log into the work account\nwhile using a regular window to stay in their account.\n4.4.5 Employ Two-Factor Authentication\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA), sometimes also called ‘two-step verification’ or ‘dual-factor\nauthentication,’ is a safety method wherein users get authentication elements to verify their identity\nbefore gaining access to an app, account, or email.\nFirst-factor authentication is the password of the account. The second authentication could either be\nthe user's mobile number or a biometric factor, such as a fingerprint or face scan. Two-factor\nauthentication provides a further layer of safety to the authentication technique by making it more\ndifficult for attackers to get access to a person’s gadgets or online assets. Online service providers\nare also increasing the usage of 2FA to guard their users’ credentials against being utilized by hackers\nwho breach databases to get their users' passwords. So, if there is 2FA, these passwords could\nnever be used singularly.\nApart from these basic preventive measures of browsing in Incognito mode, or always employing\n2FA and adopting the practice of buying anti-malware software or firewalls from authorized vendors,\none should specifically be very alert while securing one’s e-commerce usage or safeguarding their\nmobile devices with extra caution. The following sections shall cover these aspects too.\n4.5 Securing E-Commerce Usage\nWith the advent of the internet and online shopping, it has now become necessary to ensure that\ne-commerce transactions are safe and secure for all stakeholders involved. E-commerce security\nrefers to the practices that provide secure online transactions. Some of the important aspects that\ncould be kept in mind by the end-users are:\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 67\nTable 4.2 Tips to Secure e-Commerce Usage (Do’s and Don’ts)\nTips to Secure e-Commerce Usage\nDo’s\n1. Check that the e-commerce website starts with HTTPS and displays a green padlock icon\nto the left of the website’s URL.\n2. Shop only on genuine and trustworthy websites with contact details, such as email, phone\nnumber, or chat, available on them.\n3.

This is practical and time-\nsaving.\n1. It eliminates the use/circulation of fake documents, as originals are accessible only through\nthe individual's secured and authorized Digilocker account.\n2. It even cuts down on government agencies’ administrative costs by reducing their reliance\non paper.\n3. The most essential aspect is that because papers are issued directly by registered issuers,\nDigiLocker makes it easy to verify their validity.\n15 https://www.cert-in.org.in/PDF/ISA_Booklet.pdf\n70 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nFig. 4.16 Homepage of the DigiLocker Website (Source: DigiLocker Website)\nHow to Use DigiLocker\nEach citizen can use a cloud space of up to 1 GB to store their documents on DigiLocker.\nStep 1: To avail yourself of DigiLocker's services, visit the official website at\nhttps://digilocker.gov.in/. Alternatively, you can download the DigiLocker mobile application from\nyour device's App Store or Play Store.\nStep 2: The user will be directed to the DigiLocker homepage. To proceed, they should click the\n“Sign Up” tab located in the top right corner of the screen.\nStep 3: You will be redirected to an account creation page. The user would be asked to enter the\nfollowing information - full name of the user, date of birth, mobile number, and email ID.\nStep 4: The user will be asked to enter a preferred six-digit security PIN and click the ‘Submit’ tab.\nStep 5: You will receive an OTP on the provided mobile number. Enter the OTP and click on the\n‘Submit’ tab.\nStep 6: To access a broader range of documents and services, verify your identity through Aadhaar-\nbased authentication. Enter your Aadhaar number and click ‘Update’.\nStep 7: You will receive an OTP on the mobile number linked to your Aadhaar. Enter the OTP and\nclick on the ‘Submit’ tab.\nStep 8: You will be asked to create a username.

You will see different organizations\nunder various categories.\nStep 11: To get or import the documents, click on the respective organization tabs from which you\nare searching for your document and provide the required details to import your document into the\n“Issued Documents” section.\nStep 12: Once the document is imported into the “Issued Documents” section, you can access it\nanytime, anywhere. DigiLocker ’Issued Documents’ are considered as valid as original documents\nunder the IT Act, 2000.\nFig. 4.17 DigiLocker Screen to Upload Documents Online (Source: DigiLocker Website)\nNow, almost all the academic institutions and education boards issue the mark sheets of the students\nonly in the Digilocker account of the students. The option of directly receiving certificates in the\nDigiLocker of the student is indeed a good alternative to the alternative of physically carrying\nhard-copy/paper-based certificates for the students.\nHowever, students could also upload a scanned version of spurious certificates in their own\nDigiLocker accounts, particularly in those instances where the certification year is much prior\nto the time of introduction of a DigiLocker facility by the education boards.\nTherefore, to ensure the complete validity of certificates, a more secure option for education boards\nis to provide ‘blockchain-based’ certificates, which we will learn about in the next section.\n4.8.2 Blockchain\nA blockchain is a digital, tamper-proof, decentralized ledger that records transactions almost\ninstantly and monitors assets within a virtual network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash,\nland) or intangible (intellectual property, branding). Virtually anything that has any value attached to\nit can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network. Each transaction will be entered into the\nledger, providing a continual control system regarding manipulation, mistakes, and data integrity.\n72 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nFeatures of Blockchain Technology\n• Near-real time: Blockchain provides near-real-time settlement of recorded transactions,\neliminating friction and lowering risk.\n• No middleman: Instead of faith, blockchain technology is based on cryptographic evidence\nallowing any two parties to interact directly with one other without the use of a middleman.\n• Distributed ledger: The peer-to-peer distributed network keeps a public history of\ntransactions. The blockchain is made publicly available and widely accessible. Only the\nevidence of the transaction’s existence is generally preserved by the blockchain, not the\nidentities of the parties or the transaction data.\n• Irreversibility & Immutability: The blockchain maintains a precise and verifiable record of\nevery single transaction that has ever occurred. This prevents previous blocks from being\nchanged, preventing duplicate spending, fraud, abuse, and transaction manipulation.\n• Smart Contracts: Stored procedures that run on a Blockchain to perform predefined\nbusiness processes and complete a commercially/legally enforceable transaction without the\nrequirement for a middleman.\nDue to several such advantages of blockchain, some teaching and training institutes have started\nissuing completion certificates on the blockchain. Such certificates are not just in soft copy but are\nalso duly certified and tamper-proof. It leaves no scope for “fake degrees” or “fake mark sheets” and\ncould be easily validated by job-providing agencies.\n4.8.3 Parental Controls\nWith the ease of access, the internet exposes kids to various threats like identity theft, cyberbullying,\nsocial media scams, and malicious content. That is why parental control has become an essential\nrequirement to protect children.\nParental controls are features or software allowing parents to monitor and restrict their child's\nonline activities. A wide variety of programs/utilities do such things as block and filter websites\nand content, record their activities, limit their time online, and view their browsing history and\ncommunications.\nFig. 4.18 Steps to set up parental controls and popular parental control apps (Source: IIPA)\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 73\nChapter 5: Understanding the Institutional Framework\nof Cyber Security in India\nOn June 29, 2021, India was ranked the tenth best country in the world in the ‘Global Cybersecurity\nIndex’ (GCI) 2020 (International Telecommunication Union- ITU, 2020).

We shall have a brief glimpse into each\nin this chapter.\nDisclaimer: The cases cited under each act are given to support the general understanding of the acts.\nHowever, the reader should be aware that one case is not restricted to one particular act. Hence, one-on-\none correspondence on cases is not exhaustive. This has been done only to strengthen the basic concepts of\nthe reader.\n6.1 Information Technology Act 2000 (Amended in 2008)\nThe Indian Parliament introduced the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) on\nOctober 17, 2000. This law is one of India's key legislations addressing cybercrime and\ne-commerce issues, and it is enforced by the Ministry of Elecronics and Information\nTechnology (MeitY). Due to the rapid increase in computer and internet usage, the\ngovernment has amended the IT Act multiple times to tackle the evolving nature of\ncybercrimes. The Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008 (IT Act 2008)\nintroduced significant changes to the original IT Act 2000.\nSome of the relevant IT Act 2000 sections comprise the following:\n• Section 43: This section pertains to penalties and compensation for causing damage to a\ncomputer or computer system.

Its mission focuses on\nsafeguarding information and infrastructure within cyberspace, enhancing capabilities to\nprevent and respond to cyber threats, mitigating vulnerabilities, and minimizing the impact of\ncyber incidents. This is achieved through a blend of institutional frameworks, personnel,\nprocesses, technology, and collaborative efforts. The policy aims to foster a secure cyber\nenvironment and assurance framework, promote open standards, strengthen regulatory\nmeasures, manage vulnerabilities, protect e-governance services, and advance research and\ndevelopment in cybersecurity alongside human resources development.\n6.4 Directions relating to information security practices issued by\nCERT-In, MeitY\nThe Internet in India is rapidly expanding, with projections indicating that over 1.2 billion\nIndians will gain access in the coming years, utilizing it for business, education, finance, and\n84 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nvarious other applications, including digital government services. While this growth has\nspurred innovation, it has also led to increased cybercrimes, user risks, and challenges to\nonline safety. The Government of India aims to ensure that users experience a Safe & Trusted\nInternet.\nAs part of this initiative, Cyber Security Directions were introduced to enhance online safety\nand trust for users. On April 28, 2022, CERT-In issued these directions under sub-section (6)\nof section 70B of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which is overseen by MeitY. The\ngoal is to clarify for various stakeholders how to achieve compliance and promote an open,\nsafe, trusted, and accountable Internet across the country.\nThese directions aim to bolster online safety and cyber security, ensuring a secure online\nenvironment. They apply to service providers, intermediaries, data centers, corporations, and\ngovernment entities, outlining requirements such as synchronizing ICT system clocks,\nreporting cyber incidents to CERT-In, maintaining ICT system logs, and ensuring subscriber\ninformation and KYC records registration. Specifically, this applies to Data Centres, Virtual\nPrivate Server (VPS) providers, Cloud Service providers, Virtual Private Network (VPN)\nService providers, virtual asset service providers, virtual asset exchange providers, and\ncustodian wallet providers. It is important to note that these Cyber Security Directions of April\n28, 2022, do not pertain to individual citizens.\n6.4.1 Guidelines on information security practices for Government entities”\nissued by CERT-In, MeitY\nThese guidelines are designed to establish a prioritized baseline for cyber security measures\nand controls within government and affiliated organizations. They aim to assist security teams\nin implementing essential controls and procedures to safeguard their cyber infrastructure\nagainst significant threats. Additionally, these guidelines serve as foundational documents for\nadministration and audit teams (including internal, external, and third-party auditors) to assess\nan organization’s security posture in relation to cyber security baseline requirements.\nThe guidelines encompass best practices categorized into various security domains, including\nNetwork Security, Application Security, Data Security, Auditing, and third-party outsourcing.\nIssued by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), these guidelines relate\nto information security practices, procedures, prevention, and response and apply to all\nMinistries, Departments, Secretariats, and Offices listed in the First Schedule of the\nGovernment of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, along with their attached and\nsubordinate offices, as well as all government institutions, public sector enterprises, and other\ngovernment agencies under their administrative oversight.\nDiscover essential guidelines on information security practices tailored for government entities\nhere16: https://www.cert-in.org.in/PDF/guidelinesgovtentities.pdf\n6.5 National Information Security Policy and Guidelines (NISPG),\nMHA\nMHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) has been given the task of coordinating and managing public\nand private sector information security activities. It developed a National Information Security\nPolicy and Guidelines (NISPG)17 in 2013, which established information handling processes and\nprovided security guidelines for classified information assets. This policy proposed that each\ngovernment organization shall establish a security division responsible for planning, implementing,\nand overseeing all activities related to information security. The Information security wing of the\nCyber and Information Security division of MHA will be responsible for risk analysis- based on\nthreat and risk assessments emerging from technology adoption.\n16 https://www.cert-in.org.in/PDF/CERT-In_Directions_70B_28.04.2022.pdf\n17 https://surveyofindia.gov.in/pages/national-information-security-policy-and-guidelines\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 85\nThere are nine critical domains for implementing a sound information security program. These nine\ndomains work together to establish a foundation for a strong information security program. These\ndomains are:\n1. Personal Cyber-security: Personal cyber-security refers to ongoing efforts to secure\nindividual users’ accounts and devices against cyber-attacks. This is done by inculcating basic\nDo’s and Don’ts of Digital Hygiene.\n2. Physical Security: It is defined as the protection of persons, hardware, software,\nnetworks, and data from physical events that might cause catastrophic losses to an\norganization, including fire, natural catastrophes, theft, damage, or terrorism. Access control,\nSurveillance, and Testing are the three basic components of the physical security\narchitecture.\n3. Identity and Access Management (IAM): It identifies and authorizes users across the\norganization.\nPrivileged Access Management (PAM): PAM serves as a subset of IAM and focuses on\nprivileged users who need permission to access more sensitive data.\nFor instance, PAM maintains privileged account credentials (such as passwords) in a special-\npurpose, highly secure password vault.\n4. Network Security: Network security can be referred to as the measures adopted by an\norganization to safeguard its computer network and data by utilising appropriate\ntechnologies and tools such as Firewall, Network Segmentation, Remote Access VPN, E-mail\nSecurity, Sandboxing and so on.\n5. Application Security: This refers to the security measures used at the application level to\nprotect data or code inside the app from being stolen or hijacked throughout application\ndevelopment and design and after deployment.\n6. Data Security: It protects digital information against corruption, theft, or illegal access over\nits entire life cycle. It includes hardware, software, storage devices, user devices, access\nand administrative controls, and organisational rules and procedures.\n7. Information Security (InfoSec): It aims to protect and transit data sent across the network\nvia terminals. It is concerned with the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of\ninformation assets of an organization. Examples of Information Security include Procedural\nControls, Access Controls, Technical Controls, Compliance Controls, etc.\n8. Threat and Vulnerability Management: The technique of finding, categorising,\nremediating, and managing flaws in an IT environment is known as threat and vulnerability\nmanagement. It covers vulnerability detection, reporting, prioritisation, and response in the\nnetwork. With these insights, one can address security gaps before they cause a breach.\n9. Security Incident Management: The process of recognizing, monitoring, documenting,\nand evaluating security risks or occurrences in real-time is known as security incident\nmanagement. An active threat, an attempted incursion, policy breaches, and a data leak\nare all examples of security incidents.\n86 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nChapter 7: Strengthening Students, Teachers, and\nInstitutions\n7.1 Career in Cyber Security\nAs technology progresses and becomes more and more interconnected, our world becomes more\nprone to cybercrime. This can be seen in the massive rise in online criminal behavior around the\ncountry and in the world. Thus, there is an immediate need for professionals in Cybersecurity and\nDigital Forensics. Some of the job profiles that are important to protect the present digital spaces are:\n1. Intelligence Analysts: They work in the field, interrogate witnesses, perform research, conduct\nsearches, and also coordinate with law enforcement/intelligence organizations to identify and\nmitigate security concerns.\n2. Cyber Forensic Experts: They collect and analyse potential evidence, such as deleted, encrypted,\nor corrupted data, during an investigation.\n3. Cybercrime Investigators: They collect evidence from digital systems that can be utilised\nin the prosecution of internet-based or cyberspace illegal activities.\nWhile a computer forensics investigator possesses and employs many of the same abilities,\na cybercrime investigator is primarily focused on and competent at investigating crimes\nthat use the internet as the major attack vector.\n4. Cyber-security Instructors: They are responsible for devising and implementing effective\nteaching/training tactics to educate learners/employees on cyber-security skills.\n5. Technology Analysts: They communicate with the stakeholders to understand their technical\nneeds and design efficient technology systems to meet these needs. They are also responsible\nfor the smooth and consistent functioning of information technology systems.\n6. Risk and Compliance Managers/Analysts: They are in charge of liaising with relevant\nregulatory agencies to ensure adherence to risk and compliance reporting requirements,\nas well as plan and execute the internal audit programmes for compliance obligations.\nUsually, a risk and compliance analyst supports the manager in discharging these activities.\n7. Application Security Professionals: They advise and validate the secure design and\ndevelopment of IT applications, including updates to existing ones. They also identify system\nand application vulnerabilities and information security threats.\n8. Cyber-security Researchers: They specialise in the design, development, integration, and\ndeployment of cutting-edge tools, techniques, and systems to safeguard cyber operations.\n9. Red Team Professionals: The colors red, blue, and purple represent diverse cyber security\ntactics as well as highly experienced teams. These teams are in charge of defending the\norganization’s assets from unknown attacks.\nRed team raises the heat and shows businesses where their assets might be compromised. This\ncould be done by simulating an assault in controlled, natural surroundings - analogous to\ndoing regular fire drills. It then relays results back to the firm so that firms may reinforce\ntheir cyber security and seek to invest in their defensive system through offensive measures.\nThe red team is, therefore, responsible for identifying weak areas in a company’s security and\ndelivering a report of flaws.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 87\nThe blue team is composed of security experts who possess an in-depth understanding of the\norganization. Their primary responsibility is safeguarding the organization's vital assets from\nvarious threats. The blue team begins by collecting data, identifying what requires protection,\nand conducting a risk assessment to achieve this.\nOn the other hand, the purple team represents a collaborative security approach where the red\nand blue teams work together closely. This teamwork enhances cyber capabilities by fostering\ncontinuous feedback and facilitating team knowledge transfer.The purple team can help\nsecurity teams improve the effectiveness of vulnerability detection, threat hunting, and network\nmonitoring by accurately simulating common threat scenarios and facilitating the creation of new\ntechniques designed to prevent and detect new types of threats.\nApart from the job profiles discussed above, there are various other career development options\nin the field of cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving vast domain with various key areas\ninterconnected in one way or the other. Some of these key areas have been identified as governance,\nrisk assessment, career development, security operation, security architecture, threat intelligence,\nand many more (Fig. 7.1).\nFig. 7.1 Mapping of Cybersecurity Domains (Source: Henry Jiang on LinkedIn)\n7.2 Certifications and Other\nThe CCISO certificate is the highest achievement offered to chief information security officers\n(CISOs). OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional), SANS Technology Institute, ISFCE\n88 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n(International Society of Forensic Computer Examiners), IACIS (The International Association of\nComputer Investigative Specialists), GIAC (Global Information Assurance Certification), CISSP\n(Certified Information Systems Security Professional), and (ISC)2 (International Information\nSystems Security Certification) are among the organization unauthorized that provide related\nprofessional training and certifications.\nCertified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator (CHFI) CompTIA\nSecurity+, Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), CompTIA Network+, Certified\nNetwork Defender (CND), Certified Penetration Testing Engineer (CPTE), Certified Forensic\nExaminer (CFE), Certified Cyber Forensics Professional (CCFP), EnCase Certified Examiner\n(EnCE), Certified Incident Handler (GCIH), Certified Cyber Investigator (CCI).\n7.3 Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)\nNational Cybercrime Training Centre (CyTrain) aims to build the capacities of individuals through\nthe provision of certain MOOCs focused on combating cybercrimes, impact containment, and\ninvestigations. This is a virtual training Centre by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).\nThe intended trainees are officers of all ranks, including senior officers from States/Union Territories\nas well as from Central Police Organizations/Central Armed Police Forces. Some of these MOOCs\nare listed below (can be accessed through this link https://cytrain.ncrb.gov.in/course/):\n7.3.1 Common Cyber Crime Course\n7.3.2 Cybercrime Awareness for Police Officers\n7.3.3 Cybercrime Investigation: Case Studies\n7.3.4 Cybercrime Investigation: Hands-on Approach\n7.3.5 Judiciary/Prosecution Track\n7.3.6 Investigation Track\n7.4 Strengthening Teachers and IT Teams of Higher Education\nInstitutions (HEIs)\nLet us now understand clearly the changing roles and responsibilities of educators in the present\ncontext when digital tools and Edu-tech are becoming a norm. Since the technical components\nof conducting a virtual class are far more complex than conducting a session offline, the educator\nhas to take on the role of a tech specialist, facilitator, and content designer. For doing so, some of\nthe tips are:\n• Aa a Tech-Designer: Be Aware of Basics of Digital Hygiene - The educator must always\nbe on guard against various cyber threats that can occur during online classes, such as\nviolation of the classroom by unauthorized entrants or invasion of the privacy of students or\neducators, etc.\n• As a Facilitator: Use Mixed-Media and Varied Communication Techniques - The learning\npace for students could vary; there could be fast learners, and there could be slow learners in\nan online class. To ensure proper learning by all levels of students, the educator must rely on\ndifferent assessment formats in her online classroom.\nFor instance, there could be a combination of strategies such as insistence on personal video\nintroductions, parallel quizzing and queries in chat rooms, expectations of prompt responses to\ninquiries, short online quizzing in between the sessions, and unexpected/random requests to the\nstudents to switch on videos. All these techniques would ensure proper uptake of learning in digital\nmode and isolate the possibility of unexpected intrusions of rogue actors in the digital\nclassrooms.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 89\n• As a Content Designer: Select Digital Tools Appropriately - The educator must be capable\nof selecting digital tools that are:\na. appropriate for the respective learning objective\nb. could also be easily accessed and understood by students\nc. could help assess the knowledge and skills of students. To do so, educators must be\nwell-exposed to the use of AI/data analytics to properly evaluate the learning pace of\ntheir students.\nSuch threats could be avoided/minimized if an online educator takes the following basic principles\nof digital hygiene (apart from generic Do’s and Don’ts that have already been discussed in this\nhandbook):\nTable 7.1 Safety Tips to be Followed by Educators for Conducting Online Classes\n(Do’s and Don’ts)\nSafety Tips to be Followed by Educators for Conducting Online Classes\nDo’s\nDo establish certain norms for online classes. For instance, educators must insist on the use of\nweb cameras in online classes, employ follow-up emails, and conduct extensive discussion\nforums and chat rooms, apart from conducting online classes.\nDo circulate the list of protocols of Do’s (For instance, ‘Do switch on your camera, when\nrequested’) and Don’ts (For instance, ‘Don’t take screenshots’; ‘Don’t use undesirable words’, etc.)\nthat must be followed by each and every student while attending the online class.\nEnsure the provision of a ‘waiting room’ while creating links for online classes.\nCreate a unique classroom URL and secure its access with a strong password.\nDo insist that the students must not reveal their personal information to anyone until it has been\ncompletely verified that everyone who is in the online class has permission to be there.\nDon’ts\nDo not send classroom invites to unregistered email IDs/ phone numbers of students. Right at\nthe outset, of course, these student details must be taken up and verified by the educator.\nDo not publish the classroom details, including names of the speakers, students, or related URLs\nor passwords, on any public forum such as WhatsApp groups. Instead, this information could be\nshared in closed email groups.\nDo not let the students inside the online classroom without verifying their email IDs.\nConsidering the present scenario, online classes are an inevitable means to deliver knowledge, which\ndemands a great deal of time on the Internet. Thus, it is of utmost importance to make the students and\neducators aware of the possible scammers performing phishing activities and creating fake websites.\nAnother noteworthy aspect is that an individual’s privacy should not be compromised at any cost\nand financial information should not be easily accessible.\n90 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\nAs already discussed in the first chapter, with the prevailing trend in Edu-Tech, the technical\ncomponents of conducting a virtual class are far more complex than conducting a session offline.\n7.5 Some of the R&D, Capacity Building and Awareness Initiatives\nby the Government of India\nMeitY, MHA and DST (Department of Science and Technology) undertake several R&D and\nrelated academic initiatives in the cyber-security domain, as listed herewith:\n7.5.1 Information Security Education and Awareness (ISEA) under MeitY\nIn 2014, MeitY approved a program named “Information Security Education and Awareness\n(ISEA) Phase II,” which aims to build capacity in the area of information security by creating the\nright kind of qualified human resources to meet the ever-evolving challenges in this area through\nlearning (formal and non-formal courses), training of government officials, and public awareness\ncampaigns.\nThe Information Security Education and Awareness (ISEA) Project by MeitY is aimed at\ncapacity building in the area of information security for the development of human resources\nin this area. The project is implemented through a network of 52 institutions, comprising\npremier academic institutions such as IITs, NITs, Govt. Engineering Colleges, select C-DAC\n& NIELIT centres and Technical Universities. The ISEA initiative focuses on promoting\neducation (formal and non-formal courses), training government personnel, students, faculty,\nand school teachers; and educating the general public at large about cyber hygiene and cyber\nsecurity through awareness workshops, outreach activities, multilingual awareness material in\nthe form of handbooks, posters, short-videos, etc. disseminated through print, electronic and\nsocial media and through ISEA awareness portal www.infosecawareness.in. More details\nabout the ISEA program are available on https://www.isea.gov.in/\n7.5.2 Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) under MeitY\nThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology’s (MeitY) Centre for Development of\nAdvanced Computing (C-DAC) is the ministry’s primary research and development Centre for IT,\nelectronics, and related fields. C-DAC has been conducting research and development in many\nsub-areas within the Cyber Security sector.\n7.5.3 Cyber Surakshit Bharat Programme by MeitY\nCyber Surakshit Bharat program is an initiative of the Ministry of Electronics and Information\nTechnology (MeitY) with the National e-Governance Division (NeGD) as the implementing\nagency to strengthen the Indian cyber security ecosystem. The purpose of the program is to\nspread awareness, build capacity, and enable government departments to take steps that need\nto be taken to create a resilient IT setup.\nThe “Cyber Surakshit Bharat” (CSB) program was initiated in partnership with an industry\nconsortium in Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with the objective of educating & enabling\nthe Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) & broader IT community of Central/State\nGovernment banks and PSUs to address the challenges of cyber security. The technical\ncontents of the training were developed after intense discussion with industry consortium and\nknowledge partners.\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 91\nFig 7.2: Logo of Cyber Surakshit Bharat\n7.5.4 CyberDost by MHA\nVarious social media handles titled \"CyberDost\" have been created, to spread cybercrime\nawareness amongst the masses. @CyberDost aims to educate people by regularly creating\nvideos/GIFs that give cybercrime and cyber safety tips. This handle is designed to enhance\npeople's basic understanding of cybercrimes and the precautions that should be taken to\nprevent them.\n7.5.5 Cyber Volunteers program by MHA\nThe Cyber Crime Volunteers Programme, devised by I4C, seeks to bring together individuals\nwho are ardent supporters of national service under one umbrella initiative. The primary\nobjective of this endeavor is to involve citizens in the collaborative struggle against cybercrime\non a national scale.\nThose who possess good intentions are urged to participate in the Cyber Crime Volunteer\nProgram by designating themselves as flaggers of illicit content. This position is responsible\nfor assisting law enforcement agencies in identifying, reporting, and removing illicit or\nunlawful online content.\nAdditionally, volunteers interested in other activities supporting the fight against cybercrime\nare cordially invited to apply. Submissions of applications for participation should be addressed\nto the State Nodal, who will maintain communication with the applicants as required.\nThe Cyber Crime Volunteer Program offers individuals a valuable opportunity to contribute to\ncombating online criminal activities. Volunteers can play a crucial role in creating a safer\ndigital environment for all users by joining this initiative.\n7.5.6 Cyber Commandos program by I4C, MHA\nIndian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) is taking significant strides in bolstering India's\ncyber defense capabilities through the establishment of Cyber Commandos. The concept of\nCyber Commandos was first introduced during the DGPs/IGPs Conference held in the month\nof January 2023, The Hon'ble Prime Minister recommended that a Special Wing of suitably\n92 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\ntrained 'Cyber Commandos' should be established to counter threats of cyber security from the\ncyberspace. Hon’ble Prime Minister reiterated in the DGP/IGP conference held in January\n2024 that the cyber commando force should be created without any delay. These commandos\nwill undergo rigorous residential training, equipping them with the skills to respond to cyber\nthreats effectively. The training will be conducted in collaboration with top institutions. Cyber\nCommandos are conceived to a part of a National Level Force who will be stationed in\nStates/UTs/Headquarters and work for their parent organization. They are expected to be\nassigned roles according to the expertise they have developed during training in Digital\nforensics, Incident Response, and Securing ICT Infrastructure.\nSignificance of Cyber Commandos:\nBy creating a specialized force, India aims to enhance its ability to combat cybercrime\nsignificantly.\nCyber Commandos will respond to threats and proactively identify and mitigate potential\nvulnerabilities.\nThe initiative will foster a pool of highly skilled cybersecurity professionals.\n7.5.7 Some Other Related Initiatives by the Department of Science and\nTechnology (DST)\nThe Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the Ministry of Science and Technology\nis also doing research in the cyber security domain. DSTs attempt to define a national R&D agenda\nthat is required to enable the country to get ahead of adversaries and produce the technologies.\nBroad research areas include information security, digital services, and the protection of digital\nservices. The details are available at http://dst.gov.in/basic-research-cyber-security.\nFig.7.2 Some of the Capacity Building & Awareness Initiatives by GoI (Source: IIPA)\nExtract CSB Logo from https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Cyber%20Surakshit%20Brochure_.pdf\n7.5.8 National and State Level Initiatives under MHA’s Scheme of\n‘Cybercrime Prevention against Women and Children (CPWC)’\nFrom 2018 onwards, under the CPWC scheme of MHA, several initiatives have been\nundertaken to strengthen the cyber posture of the masses, particularly women and children. Some\nA Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions 93\nof the related national and state-level advents under CPWC are summarized herewith:\n7.5.8.1 The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has developed a\nspecial toolkit for cybercrimes against children.\n7.5.8.2 States/UTs have been given substantial grants to set up Cyber Forensic Training Labs and\nhire Cyber Forensic Consultants to run the labs in their respective states.\n7.5.8.3 States/UTs have also been given funding to train police officers, prosecutors, and\njudicial officers under the CPWC scheme.\n7.5.8.4 Funds have also been earmarked to facilitate cybercrime awareness and R&D by\nestablishing a Centre of Excellence (CoE) on research and development activities\nrelated to cybercrime prevention and control.\n7.5.8.5 Several courses have been designed for law enforcement agencies on ‘Cybercrime\nInvestigation,’ particularly for North Eastern states.\n7.6 Cyber Crisis Management Plan (CCMP) for Organisations\nFor combating cyber-attacks at the organizational level, the Government of India has developed\nan almost exhaustive template of a Cyber Crisis Management Plan (CCMP), which could be\nimplemented by all Central Government Ministries/Departments, State Governments, and their\nentities, and critical sectors. A Cyber Crisis Management Plan (CCMP) is a plan that provides\na strategic framework & guides actions to prepare for, respond to, and coordinate recovery\nfrom a cyber crisis. Each organization has to develop one CCMP plan, as it helps the\norganization to put in place mechanisms to effectively deal with cyber security crises and be\nable to pinpoint responsibilities and accountabilities right down to the individual level.\n7.7 Suggested Cyber Policy Guidelines for HEIs\nPolicies that clearly define what should be done and what should not be done while executing\nspecific tasks can help minimize the risk of cyber threats. Various federal rules require HEIs to\nguarantee the privacy, security, and confidentiality of personally identifiable information (PII) and/\nor information security. These federal rules could be summarised as the following:\n7.7.1 The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) prohibits educational\ninstitutions from revealing student PII or education information without written\nconsent.\n7.7.2 The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA 2014)\nmandates federal data security.\n7.7.3 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires financial institutions, including\ncolleges and universities, to protect customer personal information (PII).\n7.7.4 The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires HEIs with Title IV programs to have\ninformation security policies, controls, monitoring, and management procedures.\n7.7.5 Enrolment Agreement with the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) requires HEIs with\nTitle IV programs to preserve all Federal Student Aid applicant information.\nWhen developing cybersecurity plans, policies, and procedures, HEIs must keep these federal\nregulations in mind, as well as state and local laws related to managing information security in the\nacademic setting.\n94 A Handbook on Basics of Cyber Hygiene for Higher Education Institutions\n7.8 How to Stay Cyber-Safe: Recommended Resources\nIn today's digitally interconnected world, the threat of cyber-attacks looms large, posing\nsignificant risks to individuals and organizations alike.
